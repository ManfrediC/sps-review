AB  - Stiff-man syndrome is a rare disorder of unknown etiology in which progressive rigidity, spasms, and continuous motor unit activity may be due to dysfunction of GABAergic inhibition of alpha motor neurons. Some patients with this disorder have evidence of autoantibodies reactive with glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). We describe a patient with progressive stiff-man syndrome and high titers of GAD-like immunoreactivity in serum but not spinal fluid. Plasmapheresis resulted in lowered antibody titers, decreased exteroceptive reflex responses, reduced motor unit activity, and marked clinical improvement. Immunohistochemistry using patient serum and plasma produced specific labeling of human and experimental animal tissue consistent with GABAergic neurons and terminal fields. This antibody response was not present in samples from more than 200 other patients. These results provide additional evidence of an autoimmune mechanism for stiff-man syndrome and indicate plasmapheresis may be beneficial in some patients.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is characterized by progressive, usually symmetric rigidity of the axial muscles with superimposed painful spasms precipitated by tactile stimuli, passive stretch, volitional movement of affected or unaffected muscles, startling noises, and emotional stimuli. Electromyography demonstrates continuous normal motor unit potentials in the affected muscles. Both the rigidity and the spasms are relieved by sleep, general anesthesia, myoneural blockade, peripheral nerve blockade, and partially by diazepam. Evidence for an autoimmune etiology of SPS includes its association with other autoimmune diseases and autoantibodies and the presence of antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of many affected patients. We describe two patients with this syndrome who had GAD antibodies in both CSF and serum. Partial relief of the symptoms in these patients by corticosteroid therapy provides additional evidence of an autoimmune etiology of SPS and of the role of immunotherapy in its treatment.

AB  - Stiff-man syndrome (SMS) is a rare disorder of the central nervous system characterized by painful involuntary stiffening of axial muscles accompanied by spasms. These are often precipitated by tactile or emotional stimuli, volitional movement, and startling noises. Until recently, little has been known about the pathogenesis of SMS. There is evidence now to support the hypothesis that SMS may be an autoimmune disease. This is leading to changes in the way this disease is diagnosed and treated. We describe two patients with SMS and review the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment.

AB  - Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) is the enzyme that synthesizes the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in neurons and in pancreatic beta cells. It is a major target of autoimmunity in Stiff-Man syndrome (SMS), a rare neurological disease, and in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The two GAD isoforms, GAD-65 and GAD-67, are the products of two different genes. GAD-67 and GAD-65 are very similar to each other in amino acid sequence and differ substantially only at their NH2-terminal region. We have investigated the reactivity of autoantibodies of 30 Stiff-Man syndrome patients to GAD. All patient sera contained antibodies that recognize strongly GAD-65, but also GAD-67, when tested by immunoprecipitation on brain extracts and by immunoprecipitation or immunocytochemistry on cells transfected with either the GAD-65 or the GAD-67 gene. When tested by Western blotting, all patient sera selectively recognized GAD-65. Western blot analysis of deletion mutants of GAD-65 demonstrated that autoantibodies are directed predominantly against two regions of the GAD-65 molecule. All SMS sera strongly recognized a fragment contained between amino acid 475 and the COOH terminus (amino acid 585). Within this region, amino acids 475-484 and 571-585 were required for reactivity. The requirement of these two discontinuous segments implies that the epitope is influenced by conformation. This reactivity is similar to that displayed by the monoclonal antibody GAD 6, suggesting the presence of a single immunodominant epitope (SMS-E1) in this region of GAD-65. In addition, most SMS sera recognized at least one epitope (SMS-E2) in the NH2-terminal domain of GAD-65 (amino acids 1-95). The demonstration in SMS patients of a strikingly homogeneous humoral autoimmune response against GAD and the identification of dominant autoreactive target regions may help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of GAD processing and presentation involved in GAD autoimmunity. Moreover, the reactivity reported here of GAD autoantibodies in SMS partially differs from the reactivity of GAD autoantibodies in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, suggesting a link between the pattern of humoral autoimmunity and the clinical condition.

AB  - Following several months of low back pain, a 36-year-old man developed progressive stiffness of the abdominal, low back, and thigh muscles. On examination, these muscles demonstrated marked hypertonia consistent with the clinical diagnosis of stiff-person syndrome. The patient demonstrated increased lumbar lordosis and had focal hyperhidrosis at different sites. Electromyography showed continuous activity of the paraspinal and thigh muscles, and serum and cerebrospinal fluid antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) were markedly elevated. Diazepam and Lioresal offered partial pain relief. Paraspinal muscle administration of botulinum toxin A reduced the tone of paraspinal and thigh muscles significantly and resulted in marked improvement of ambulation and cessation of pain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The stiff-man syndrome is a rare disease of the central nervous system characterized by progressive rigidity of the body musculature. Autoantibodies directed against glutamic acid decarboxylase are present in about 60 percent of patients with the syndrome. In this group, there is a striking association of the stiff-man syndrome with organ-specific autoimmune diseases, primarily insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus., METHODS: We studied three women with the stiff-man syndrome and breast cancer, seeking autoantibodies directed against nervous system antigens in serum and cerebrospinal fluid by immunocytochemical techniques, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation., RESULTS: Autoantibodies directed against a 128-kd brain protein were found in two of the women with the stiff-man syndrome and breast cancer. These results led to a search for breast cancer in the third patient with the stiff-man syndrome, who also had autoantibodies. A small invasive ductal carcinoma was detected by ultrasonography and removed. Serum samples from all three patients were negative for autoantibodies directed against glutamic acid decarboxylase. Autoantibodies against the 128-kd antigen were not detected in control patients with the stiff-man syndrome without breast cancer or in patients with cancer who did not have the syndrome. Within the nervous system, the 128-kd autoantigen was localized in neurons and concentrated at synapses., CONCLUSIONS: In a subgroup of patients with the stiff-man syndrome, the condition is likely to have an autoimmune paraneoplastic origin. The detection of autoantibodies against the 128-kd antigen in patients with this syndrome should be considered an indication to search for an occult breast cancer.

AB  - Two-thirds of stiff-man syndrome (SMS) patients harbor an autoantibody specific for a 64-kD species of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the rate-limiting enzyme in GABA synthesis. We assayed SMS antisera from two patients with SMS for the presence of anti-GAD antibodies using Western blot, immunohistochemical, and enzymatic analyses. Both SMS antisera recognized an 80-kD antigen present in human and rat neuronal extracts, and failed to recognize the 64-kD GAD species. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated neuronal binding identical to that reported with anti-GAD antibodies. Both sera depleted GAD activity from brain extracts. Our analysis indicates that these SMS antisera differ from previously reported SMS antisera by recognizing a novel 80-kD antigen, and suggests that they contain antibodies directed against either a species of GAD different in size from the 64-kD enzyme, or a protein that co-immunoprecipitates with GAD.

AB  - Stiff-man syndrome is a rare neurological disorder characterized by skeletal muscle rigidity and spasms in which detection of circulating anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies has suggested an autoimmune pathogenesis. To further define the role of autoimmunity in the pathogenesis, we studied anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, as well as organ- and non-organ-specific autoantibodies in 13 patients with stiff-man syndrome and 127 patients with other neurological disorders. Thyrogastric antibodies were more frequent in patients with stiff-man syndrome (46%) than in those with other neurological disorders (12%) (p < 0.05). Non-organ-specific antibodies were found at a similar frequency in the patients with stiff-man syndrome (61%) and those with other neurological disorders (65%). Islet-cell autoantibodies and anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies were more common in stiff-man syndrome patients (38% and 31%) compared to the patients with other neurological disorders (6% and 3%, respectively; p < 0.001). With the exception of 1 patient in the other neurological disorders group, anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies were always associated with islet-cell autoantibodies. Four patients with stiff-man syndrome had an associated solid tumor: 3 of them had antibodies recognizing a 125/130-kd protein and not glutamic acid decarboxylase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Stiff-man syndrome is a neurologic disorder characterized by progressive rigidity of skeletal muscles. Deficiency of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid and autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the enzyme synthesizing gamma-aminobutyric acid, are closely associated with the disorder, although the relevant antigenic epitopes have not been identified. In the present study, sera from two patients with SMS was used in an immunoblotting assay with recombinant GAD67 (M(r) 67,000) and GAD65 (M(r) 65,000) isoforms to test whether SMS sera can recognize specific epitopes. We found that both SMS sera recognized the GAD65, but not the GAD67, isoform. Using 13 different synthetic GAD peptides to block the autoantibodies, two GAD65 epitopes were identified. One epitope recognized by both patients' sera, was blocked by the peptide representing amino acid residues 354-368. In one patient only, blocking was also observed by a peptide representing residues 390-402, which includes the binding site of the GAD cofactor, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. A single amino acid substitution in GAD65 at position 401 (leucine to proline) and representing the analogous GAD67 sequence in this region significantly reduced the peptide's inhibitory effect. These findings suggest that SMS GAD autoantibodies share distinct GAD65 linear epitopes and that some SMS patients' autoantibodies may block the active site, explaining SMS GABA deficiency.

AB  - The smaller form of the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) is a major autoantigen in two human diseases that affect its principal sites of expression. Thus, destruction of pancreatic beta cells, which results in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and impairment of GABA-ergic synaptic transmission in Stiff-Man syndrome (SMS) are both characterized by circulating autoantibodies to GAD65. Anti-GAD65 autoantibodies in IDDM are predominantly directed to conformational epitopes. Here we report the characterization of humoral autoimmune responses to GAD65 in 35 SMS patients, of whom 13 (37%) also had IDDM. All SMS patients immunoprecipitated native GAD65 and the main titers were orders of magnitude higher than in IDDM patients. Furthermore, in contrast to the situation in IDDM, autoantibodies in 35 of 35 (100%) of SMS patients recognized denatured GAD65 on Western blots. Two major patterns of epitope specificity were identified on Western blots. The first pattern, detected in 25 of 35 SMS patients (71%), of whom 11 had IDDM (44%), was predominantly reactive with a linear NH2-terminal epitope residing in the first eight amino acids of GAD65. Nine of nine individuals who were HLA-haplotyped in this group carried an IDDM susceptibility haplotype and HLA-DR3, DQw2 was particularly abundant. The second pattern, detected in 10 of 35 patients (29%) of whom two had IDDM (20%), included reactivity with the NH2-terminal epitope plus strong reactivity with one or more additional epitope(s) residing COOH-terminal to amino acid 101. The second epitope pattern may represent epitope spreading in the GAD65 molecule, but may also include some cases of epitope recognition associated with IDDM resistant HLA-haplotypes. The principal NH2-terminal linear epitope in GAD65 distinguishes the reactivity of SMS and IDDM autoantibodies and may be a determinant of pathogenicity for GABA-ergic neurons. The greater magnitude and distinct specificity of the humoral response to GAD65 in SMS may reflect a biased involvement of the T helper cell type 2 (Th2) subset of CD4+ T cells and antibody responses, whereas IDDM is likely mediated by the Th1 subset of CD4+ T cells and cytotoxic T cell responses.

AB  - Stiff-man syndrome (SMS) is a rare disorder characterized by progressive rigidity, stiffness, and spasms of axial and extremity muscles. The etiology of SMS is unknown, but evidence suggests a possible autoimmune basis. The recent successful use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in treating various autoimmune neuromuscular disorders led us to try IVIG in an uncontrolled pilot study on three patients. All three showed subjective and objective improvement.

AB  - Amphiphysin, a neuronal protein first identified in chicken synaptic membranes, is the autoantigen of Stiff-Man Syndrome (SMS) associated with breast cancer. We have now cloned human amphiphysin and found the N- and C-terminal domains of the protein to be highly conserved between chicken and human. Patient autoantibodies have a distinct pattern of reactivity with amphiphysin, and the dominant autoepitope is located in its C-terminal region, which contains an SH3 domain. Portions of chicken and human amphiphysin are also homologous to portions of Rvs167 and Rvs161, two yeast proteins which are involved in cell entry into stationary phase upon exposure to unfavourable growth conditions.

AB  - The clinical, biochemical, neuroimaging and neurophysiological findings of eight patients with stiff man syndromes (SMS) [four of six being tested with autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)] are presented. In two patients (one GAD-positive, one GAD-negative), transient oculomotor disturbances suggested progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) as differential diagnosis. The catalogue of characteristic clinical symptoms of SMS is extended by three new symptoms: (1) an aura-like feeling reported by five patients to precede spontaneous spasmodic attacks; (2) a stereotyped motor pattern seen in seven patients during spasmodic jerks, consisting of brief opisthotonos, stiffening of the slightly abducted legs and inversion of the plantar-flexed feet; (3) a paroxysmal fear when crossing a free space unaided, or even thinking of it. Clinical findings did not enable us to discriminate between patients tested GAD-positive or GAD-negative. Cerebrospinal fluid contained elevated immunoglobulin levels or cell counts, or both, in the majority of patients. Autopsy of one patient revealed scattered lymphocyte cuffs around leptomeningeal, intracerebral and particularly intraspinal vessels, suggesting a mild inflammatory process. Whether SMS and PERM are closely related is discussed; they are possibly both manifestations of a spectrum of encephalomyelopathies having autoimmunity against GABAergic neurons in common.

AB  - Stiff-man syndrome is a well-described, but rare and often overlooked, neuromuscular syndrome of rigidity, spasm, and gait abnormality that is associated with several endocrinologic and autoimmune disorders. A patient exhibiting many typical features of stiff-man syndrome had intermittent symptoms for 22 years before the correct diagnosis was made. Similar to many described patients, she was diabetic, hyperthyroid, and had elevated islet cell, antithyroid, and glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody levels. The high frequency of diabetes mellitus among patients with stiff-man syndrome is emphasized, as is increasing evidence to suggest that elaboration of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase and anti-islet cell antibodies may play a role in the pathophysiologic state of the disorder.

AB  - We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intrathecal baclofen (ITB) in stiff-man syndrome. Three patients, unresponsive to current therapy, received 50 micrograms of ITB or placebo on sequential days. Following ITB, all patients demonstrated improvement in reflex EMG activity. The mean reduction in total EMG activity (from all muscles) following stimulation of the medial plantar nerve (cutaneous flexor reflex) was 72% following 50 micrograms of ITB compared with 18% following placebo (ANOVA: significance of F, p < 0.0001). The mean latency to onset of the response was also significantly prolonged for all muscles following ITB (ANOVA: significance of F, p < 0.05). Although reflex EMG activity was reduced in all patients, clinical improvement was evident in only one patient, who differed from the others studied by a longer duration of disease, greater severity of stiffness, less fear of falling, and greater electrophysiologic improvement.

AB  - Stiff-man syndrome is a rare neurologic disorder characterized by progressive, fluctuating muscle rigidity with painful muscle contractions affecting predominantly the back and proximal extremities. In the ED, the diagnosis can be easily overlooked and misdiagnosed as acute or chronic low back pain and muscle spasm. This syndrome is often associated with diabetes, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. This report describes an illustrative case of a 39-year-old woman who presented to the ED with a two-year history of right leg spasms and low back pain that had become so severe in the preceding two days that she was unable to ambulate. Clues to the patient's proper diagnosis coincide with the diagnostic criteria for stiff-man syndrome: the presence of a slowly progressive stiffness of the axial muscles and proximal limb muscles, making ambulation difficult; hyperlordosis of the lumbar spine; episodic spasms precipitated by jarring or sudden movement; a normal intellectual, sensory, and motor examination when not in spasm; and a marked amelioration of symptoms with the IV administration of diazepam. High-dose oral diazepam is the maintenance drug of choice.

AB  - The neurophysiological findings in eight patients with the stiff man syndrome (SMS), including four of six tested with autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase, are presented. Neurophysiological findings did not make it possible to discriminate between patients with and those without autoimmunity against GABAergic neurons. Investigation of mono- and polysynaptic reflexes revealed abnormal results in a variable number of SMS patients, the abnormalities largely corresponding to those seen in spastic paresis. A stereotyped motor response to electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves was recorded from the trunk muscles of all patients investigated. This response was termed spasmodic reflex myoclonus and consisted of a sequence of 1-3 synchronous myoclonic bursts, 60-70 ms after median nerve stimulation, followed by a tonic decrescendo activity over a number of seconds. The recruitment order of muscles along the neuraxis in spasmodic reflex myoclonus suggested that the latter was generated in the spinal cord and conveyed via propriospinal tracts. It is thought that spasmodic reflex myoclonus may serve not only as a diagnostic tool, but also as a key to understanding some aspects of the pathophysiology of both spasms and stiffness in SMS. It is speculated that stiffness is a fragment of spasms, both being generated by common neuronal mechanisms tentatively ascribed to interneurons in the spinal grey matter.

AB  - A 40-year-old Taiwanese farmer developed progressive stiffness and pain in the lower back with intermittent cramps over a 3-year period. The cramps were extremely painful and the patient was sensitive to any sudden movement or external stimulation. His lower back was so stiff that the patient had great difficulty performing daily activities and walked with a rigid and straight back. The stiffness of the muscles subsided during normal sleep. Except for a left S1 radiculopathy, no other neurologic abnormalities were noted. Electromyography showed spontaneous continuous muscle fiber activity which was markedly suppressed after a trial with 20 mg intravenous diazepam. The muscular stiffness disappeared during treatment with oral diazepam 80 mg daily, which was tapered to 15 mg daily without any recurrence of spasm for 20 months. This is the first report of stiff-man syndrome in a Taiwanese patient and emphasizes the importance of recognizing this treatable disease.

AB  - Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) is an autoantigen in two autoimmune diseases, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and stiff-man syndrome (SMS). However, most individuals with one of these diseases do not have the other disease. Prior studies have suggested that the natures of the GAD Abs associated with each of these diseases are different, which may have implications for the autoimmune pathogenesis. We have compared the GAD autoantibody profile and have mapped GAD protein epitope regions in the two diseases using an immunoprecipitation assay with recombinant GAD 65 and GAD 67 proteins, GAD protein fragments, and synthetic GAD peptides, as well as chimeric GAD proteins. Our results indicate that individuals with SMS have GAD Abs in 100- to 500-fold higher titer than individuals with IDDM. The population of GAD Abs in SMS sera is quite complex and includes those that recognize at least three GAD 65 epitope regions located between amino acids 1-16, 188-442, and 442-563. These types of GAD Abs are not found in IDDM sera. All SMS sera also had Ab specificity that binds GAD 67 in a region highly homologous to amino acids 188-442 of GAD 65. In contrast to prior studies that used immunoblotting to measure GAD Abs, we find GAD Abs in SMS sera also target two conformation-dependent regions of GAD 65, one located in the middle and one near the C-terminus of the protein. These two regions of the GAD 65 protein are similar to regions targeted by GAD 65-specific Abs found in individuals with IDDM. These results indicate that although disease-specific epitopes may exist, there is also overlap in the humoral response between the two diseases.

AB  - Paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis developed as the presenting feature of small-cell lung carcinoma in 3 patients. Two patients with paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis manifested predominantly as subacute sensory neuronopathy did not improve after prednisone treatment and chemotherapy. The third patient had severe axial and limb rigidity and myoclonus, which partially improved after chemotherapy and treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and prednisone. Serum from each patient immunocytochemically stained the neuropil and to a lesser degree the neuronal cytoplasm in human cerebral and cerebellar cortex. On immunoblots of human neuronal extracts, each patient's serum contained high-titer IgG antibodies reacting with a protein band of apparent molecular mass 125 kd. This autoantibody pattern is indistinguishable from antibodies recently identified in several women with breast carcinoma and stiff-man syndrome. Screening of a human brain complementary DNA expression library with patient serum yielded clones whose sequence is identical to that of the synaptic vesicle-related protein amphiphysin. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated expression of amphiphysin in 8 of 10 small-cell lung carcinomas and in 5 of 14 breast carcinomas. These observations highlight the clinical and serological heterogeneity of paraneoplastic central nervous system disorders: Patients with a given clinical syndrome may have different antineuronal antibodies, and patients with a given autoantibody specificity have differing clinical presentations.

AB  - Retrospective psychological evaluation of nine patients with stiff-man syndrome (SMS), seven of whom evidenced autoimmune disease, revealed a characteristic set of psychological symptoms or features: Major stressful life events preceded the development of permanent symptoms by 6 months or less (seven patients); transient motor symptoms occurred in emotionally distressing situations months or even years before the onset of a permanent motor deficit (five patients); after onset, similar situations specifically precipitated or augmented stiffness and spasms (five patients). We also found task-specific fear resembling agoraphobia (six patients) and loss or invalidation of one or both parents, or loss of home, in childhood (seven patients). Eight patients were initially misdiagnosed as having psychogenic movement disorder. We conclude that the common misdiagnosis of SMS as a psychogenic movement disorder is due to the compelling association of a set of salient psychological features, bizarre and fluctuating motor symptoms, and lack of approved neurologic signs.

AB  - The pathogenetic role of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies found in up to 60% of patients with stiff-man syndrome (SMS) is still controversial. GAD, in fact, is also one of the major target antigen of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), a disease affecting one third of anti-GAD antibody-positive patients with SMS. To better define the role of autoimmunity in SMS we looked for molecular and immunological evidence of an autoimmune recognition of a second IDDM-associated autoantigen, the pancreatic 37/40 kDa IDDM-autoantigen, whose gene called ICA 105 has been recently cloned. By Northern blot analysis we found that tissue distribution of human ICA 105 is restricted to pancreas and brain and within the central nervous system (CNS) its distribution is similar to GAD. We also measured anti-ICA 105 antibodies in 11 SMS patients and 56 control patients with other neurological diseases (OND). Anti-ICA 105 antibodies were found in 4/11 (36%) patients with SMS (a frequency similar to that of anti-GAD-antibodies in our SMS population) but in only 2/56 (3%) patients with OND (P < 0.001). Anti-ICA 105 and anti-GAD antibodies were associated in 3/4 (75%) patients with SMS but in none of the 2 anti-ICA 105 antibody-positive OND patients. Among anti-ICA 105 antibody-positive patients with SMS, only 1 suffered also from IDDM. In contrast, the only 2 anti-ICA 105 antibody-positive with OND had IDDM. Our results indicate that ICA 105 represents another putative neuroendocrine autoantigen in SMS. The presence of circulating anti-GAD and/or anti-ICA 105 antibodies might help the diagnosis of SMS. The absence, however, of antibodies recognising specific CNS autoantigens (e.g. GAD, ICA 105) does not rule out SMS.

AB  - A 60-year-old woman presented with stiff-person syndrome (SPS). Treatment with diazepam controlled her painful spasms initially. Two and one-half years after the onset of SPS, new spells of paroxysmal leg jerking and apnea developed. A spell was recorded with simultaneous video and polygraphic techniques that revealed simultaneous firing of motor unit potentials in several muscles (paraspinal, internal hamstring, and abdominal muscles). Apnea was associated with arterial oxygen desaturation. An increase in the dose of diazepam decreased the number and severity of these episodes. Seventeen months later, the patient began to taper the diazepam dose. Shortly thereafter, she had a cardiorespiratory arrest and subsequently died. Autopsy showed small chronic inflammatory foci in the pancreas (some associated with islets) and findings of diffuse encephalomyelitis characterized by perivascular cuffing in the spinal cord, brainstem, thalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala and a dense mononuclear infiltrate in the anterior horns of the lumbar and cervical cord, with relative preservation of axons and myelin. Cell typing showed this infiltrate was polyclonal and reactive. There have been rare cases of SPS associated with encephalomyelitis reported previously. Although the prolonged course in our patient suggested that SPS may have preceded encephalomyelitis, the more likely explanation is that the patient had an unusually long course of encephalomyelitis alone.

AB  - We describe a patient with autoimmune insulin-dependent diabetes whose original symptoms of trunk stiffness and rigidity of the abdomen were followed three years later by a pancerebellar syndrome. An autoantibody (autoAb) against GABAergic neurons was found in the patient's serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); on Western blot, this autoAb recognized a 64-kDa antigen of cerebellar protein. The detection of this antibody in a case with ataxia suggests that a spectrum of different neurological diseases may be observed in patients harbouring anti-GABAergic neuron autoAb and supports the concept that factors other than autoAb contribute to the clinical presentation of these disorders.

AB  - Many neurologic conditions can affect the striated muscle of the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in dysphagia. In this article, two patients with rare neurologic disorders are reported (Stiff-man syndrome and Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome). Both patients had pharyngeal dysphagia. In addition, there was evidence of smooth muscle involvement in other areas of the gastrointestinal tract, specifically abnormal esophageal motility and delayed gastric emptying. In the English literature, there are only two reports of Stiff-man syndrome and dysphagia, and there are no reports of Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome. These represent the first accounts of smooth muscle dysfunction in those uncommon neurologic disorders.

AB  - Four patients had a chronic progressive disorder beginning in middle age and involving stiffness and painful spasms of the lower limbs. Spasms were spontaneous, reflex, and induced by voluntary movement. Patients had rigidity and abnormal postures of one or both legs. There was no truncal rigidity or exaggerated lumbar lordosis. Despite the presence of symptoms for up to 16 years, symptoms and signs of brainstem, pyramidal, and sensory dysfunction were absent. Sphincter disturbance developed after many years in one patient. Extensive investigation, including imaging of the whole neuroaxis, failed to disclose a cause. Anti-GAD antibodies were absent. Baclofen and diazepam led to some reduction in the painful spasms, but patients remained disabled by the condition. There were four core electrophysiological features. (1) Continuous motor unit activity was present at rest in at least one limb muscle. (2) Spasms tended to involve the repetitive grouped discharge of motor units. (3) Cutaneomuscular reflexes were abnormal. (4) There was little or no electrophysiological evidence of long tract disturbance. The patients form a characteristic syndrome, separate from the stiff man syndrome, and distinguishable from encephalomyelitis with rigidity. It is suggested that the condition is due to a chronic spinal interneuronitis.

AB  - Antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are found in about 40% of patients with stiff man syndrome. A new assay involving immunoprecipitation of (125)I-glutamic acid decarboxylase was used to measure anti-GAD antibodies in 18 patients with stiff man syndrome. Of the eight serum samples from patients with stiff man syndrome, that had previously been found positive by immunoprecipitation of (35)S-GAD, seven were strongly positive with (125)I-GAD and one gave an equivocal result. Other serum samples from patients with stiff man syndrome and from controls were negative except one from a patient who had a thymoma, acquired neuromyotonia, and myasthenia gravis. Nine of 35 serum samples referred for testing were positive; in two of these the serum titre was 20-50 times higher than that in the CSF. This assay should prove useful in the diagnosis, management, and investigation of stiff man syndrome.

AB  - We report the first case of stiff-persons' (-man) syndrome in the setting of a histologically proven thymoma. Muscular hyperactivity was abolished under general anesthesia and the symptoms of stiffness resolved after thymectomy and three courses of intravenous immunoglobulins. After thymectomy, the patient developed ocular myasthenia gravis which later resolved spontaneously. We suggest that thymoma be sought for in cases with neuromuscular hyperactivity syndromes. Myasthenia gravis may develop subsequently in these cases.

AB  - We describe a case of stiff-man syndrome accompanied by diabetes mellitus, Hashimoto's thyroiditis and the antecedent myasthenia gravis. The diagnosis of stiff-man syndrome was made based on not only clinical findings and the characteristic electromyographic pattern but also the presence of antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Stiff-man syndrome is known to be associated with organ-specific autoimmunopathy including insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The present case is the first one that stiff-man syndrome was preceded by myasthenia gravis of organ-specific autoimmunopathy. Stiff-man syndrome in the present case probably represents the one of fully expressed manifestations from the broad spectrum of organ-specific autoimmunopathy caused by the loss of self-tolerance.

AB  - We report the case of a female patient, who died at the age of 66 years. Besides an insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) she had developed the clinical symptoms of stiff-man-syndrome (SMS) and harbored autoantibodies against glutamate-decarboxylase (GAD) in blood and liquor. GAD catalyzes the biosynthesis of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The autopsy revealed typical alterations observed in diabetes mellitus including an incomplete fibrosis of pancreatic Langerhans islets. A decrease of GABA-ergic cells in the cerebellar cortex was observed, and a size reduction of Renshaw cells in the spinal cord. Furthermore, a dilution series of a polyclonal GABA antibody delivered a reduced immunofluorescence in the cerebellum. In skeletal muscle a neurogenic atrophy was observed. As described in literature, the clinical symptoms decayed following clonazepam administration. We suggest that this case including GAD autoantibodies, dramatic loss of GAD-expressing pancreatic cells, and loss or atrophy of GABA secretory neurons, supports the hypothesis that SMS may be an autoimmune disease directed against GABA-ergic cells. Furthermore, we suggest a neuronal hypersensitivity at the spinal cord level caused by the atrophic Renshaw cells.

AB  - A 14-month-old girl had experienced sudden episodes of breath-holding and spasms of the trunk and limb muscles, leading to cyanosis and loss of consciousness since 3 months of age. Her clinical features and electromyography suggested Stiffman syndrome, and her response to high-dose diazepam and baclofen confirmed the diagnosis. Stiffman syndrome is a rare entity, rarer still in childhood. This is the youngest case of sporadic Stiffman syndrome reported in literature. Distinguishing Stiffman syndrome from similar conditions such as Schwartz-Jampel syndrome or neuromyotonia is important because administration of GABAergic agents (valproate, baclofen, diazepam) elicits a good response.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stiff-man syndrome is a rare central nervous system disease first described nearly 40 years ago. Its cause has been attributed to both neurologic and psychiatric processes. In recent years, it has been accepted as a neurologic condition in which the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system malfunctions, probably because of an autoimmune process. Published reports that have described psychiatric manifestations of the disease have relied on descriptions of one or two cases and literature reviews., METHOD: We reviewed the medical records of 24 patients with confirmed stiff-man syndrome, 12 of whom had received psychiatric consultation. This review was done to better determine the psychiatric manifestations of stiff-man syndrome., RESULTS: Retrospective analysis of these 12 cases showed that the most common psychiatric symptoms were anxiety, depression, and alcohol abuse., CONCLUSION: We speculate that the GABA system is involved in both the neurologic and psychiatric symptoms of these patients. Psychiatrists have a significant role in the management of patients with stiff-man syndrome and may be expected to manage anxiety, depression, and substance misuse.

AB  - We studied the effect of botulinum toxin A (BTA) on painful muscular spasms and rigidity in two bedridden patients with clinical, electrophysiologic, and immunologic evidence of stiff-person syndrome. We injected BTA or saline solution into several limb muscles with both the rater and patient blinded to the order of the injections. A physician, unaware of the treatment order, used an objective rating scale for rigidity and spasm frequency scale and independently assessed the treatment results. BTA administration significantly reduced rigidity and stopped the spasms in all limbs. Following BTA injection on one side, the spasm frequency decreased bilaterally possibly because of the spread of hematogenous toxin.

AB  - We report on eight patients with stiff-man syndrome (SMS) or its "plus" variant, progressive encephalomyelopathy with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) receiving intrathecal baclofen via pump. In six of the patients, follow-ups continued for approximately 2.5 to 6.5 years after pump implantation. Intrathecal baclofen was an effective last-resort alternative for patients who responded poorly to or did not tolerate oral antispasticity medications. General mobility increased, and spasms and rigidity were reduced; however, no complete remissions were observed either before or after pump implantation. PERM patients showed more severe and rapid progression of symptoms and more attacks of autonomic dysregulation than SMS patients. They also required higher doses and more rapid dosage increases. Complications of intrathecal baclofen therapy included spasm-induced rupture of the catheter, catheter dislocation causing radicular symptoms, and pump malfunction resulting in inaccurate dosage administration. Patients suffered fewer side effects with intrathecal baclofen than with oral medication, but overdose resulted in a transient, comalike state in one patient and sudden dosage reduction due to pump failure was fatal in another.

AB  - We report a patient who developed stiff-man syndrome, including disabling shoulder subluxation and wrist ankylosis, in association with breast cancer. Immunologic investigations disclosed autoimmunity directed against not only glutamic acid decarboxylase but also amphiphysin, a 128-kd protein located in the presynaptic compartment of neurons. The patient improved after surgery and corticosteroid treatment and has been stable for nearly 4 years on only anti-estrogenics. The triad of stiff-man syndrome, breast cancer, and autoantibodies against amphiphysin identifies a new autoimmune paraneoplastic syndrome of the CNS.

AB  - We report on 2 patients who presented stiffness and spasms similar to those of stiff-man syndrome (SMS) that were limited to one leg for up to 11 years. Patients had serum glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) autoantibodies in high titer, clinical evidence of organ-specific autoimmunity, and electromyographic pattern of continuous motor unit activity with abnormally enhanced exteroceptive reflexes. The clinical and immunological profile suggests that this disorder may be a focal form of SMS.

AB  - Thirteen patients with stiff-man syndrome (SMS) were studied with the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), the Self-Administered Alcoholism Screening Test (SAAST), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) profiles, and by telephone interviews. The mean MMPI, SAAST, and STAI were within normal limits; however, several patients had abnormal profiles. The results of telephone interviews revealed that 8 patients (62%) had been given at least 1 psychiatric diagnosis and 4 (31%) abused alcohol or were dependent on it. Two patients had a psychiatric diagnosis that preceded the onset of symptoms of SMS. The authors hypothesize that SMS patients have a gamma-aminobutyric acid deficiency or GABAergic neuron dysfunction that leads to psychiatric symptoms, including depression and chemical abuse. Clinicians treating patients with SMS must be alert to the possible presence of comorbid psychiatric illnesses in this patient population.

AB  - In an atypical case of stiff-person syndrome (SPS), spinal T2-weighted MRI revealed a hyperintense lesion extending from C2 to C7 that corresponded with the clinical symptoms and signs. CSF showed lymphocytic pleocytosis and oligoclonal bands. Amphiphysin autoantibodies were detected in serum and CSF; however, unlike other reported cases, no malignancy occurred during a 3-year observation period. Methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide pulse therapy led to a marked reduction of symptoms.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Humoral and cellular immune reactivity are reported for two neuroendocrine autoantigens-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and the protein tyrosine phosphatase IA-2-in a patient with the autoimmune type of stiff-man syndrome and insulin dependent diabetes (IDDM)., METHODS: Antibodies and T cell proliferation against GAD and IA-2 and cytokine release of antigen stimulated T cells (IFN-gamma) were determined before and several times during immunosuppressive therapy with prednisolone., RESULTS: Raised GAD antibodies against full length GAD65 or chimeric constructs were detected before therapy and they remained at a high concentration despite a marked clinical improvement during cortisone treatment. Antibodies to IA-2 were undetectable, but weak T cell responses to both GAD and IA-2 were seen before therapy and once on reduction of high cortisone dosages when the patient showed signs of clinical deterioration. Cytokine profiles showed increased IFN-gamma production after stimulation with GAD or IA-2 suggesting increased activation of TH1 cells., CONCLUSION: Immunosuppressive therapy --even with extremely high doses of 500 mg a day--does not lead to the reduction of antibody concentrations in the periphery nor to a switch in epitope recognition of such antibodies despite clinical improvement. The amount of T cell reactivity to various antigens, however, may be a useful marker to monitor the effectiveness of immunotherapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the stiff limb syndrome may be separated from the stiff man syndrome and progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity on simple clinical grounds, and whether such a distinction has implications for aetiology, treatment, and prognosis., METHODS: Twenty three patients referred over a 10 year period with rigidity and spasms in association with continuous motor unit activity, but without evidence of neuromyotonia, extrapyramidal or pyramidal dysfunction or focal lesions of the spinal cord were reviewed. The patients were divided into those with an acute or subacute illness, leading to death within 1 year, and those with a chronic course. The latter were divided into those in whom rigidity and spasms dominated in the axial muscles, or in one or more distal limbs, at the time of their first assessment., RESULTS: This simple division identified three distinct groups of patients. (1) Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity: two patients had a rapidly progressive condition characterised by widespread rigidity which resulted in death within 6 and 16 weeks. One patient had negative anti-GAD and anti-neuronal antibodies, but had markedly abnormal CSF and widespread denervation. The principal pathological findings in this case were a subacute encephalomyelitis which primarily affected the grey matter. In the remaining patient anti-GAD antibodies were not tested, and postmortem was refused. (2) Stiff man syndrome: eight patients had rigidity and painful spasms of the lumbar paraspinal, abdominal, and occasionally proximal leg muscles associated with a lumbar hyperlordosis. There was no involvement of the upper limbs, distal lower limbs, sphincters or cranial nerves. Seven had anti-GAD antibodies and most had additional evidence of autoimmune disease. Neurophysiologically there was continuous motor unit activity with abnormal exteroceptive reflexes, but a normal interference pattern during spasms. The patients all responded to baclofen/diazepam and remained ambulant. (3) Stiff limb syndrome: thirteen patients had rigidity, painful spasm, and abnormal postures of the distal limb, ususphincter or brainstem involvement. Generalised myoclonic jerks were not a feature. Only two had truncal rigidity, and another two had anti-GAD antibodies. Most had no evidence of autoimmune disease. Neurophysiologically they had continuous motor unit activity in the affected limb, abnormal exteroceptive reflexes, and abnormally segmented EMG activity during spasms. The disease ran a protracted course, and most patients had only a partial response to baclofen or diazepam. About half became wheelchair bound., CONCLUSIONS: The stiff limb syndrome seems distinct from the stiff man syndrome or progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity, and is an important cause of rigidity and spasm in the setting of continuous motor unit activity.

AB  - We describe a patient with type 1 diabetes with recurrent diabetic ketoacidosis and severe insulin resistance. Extensive evaluation of the etiology of the insulin resistance did not reveal an etiology, and well over 1000 U of daily insulin did not prevent the ketoacidosis. Her blood glucose and insulin requirements were improved with glucocorticoids and octreotide, but the effects of both of these agents were short-lived. She was given a trial of insulin lispro with immediate and dramatic effects, lowering her HbA1c from 14.6 to 5.1% in 7 months with a decrease in insulin requirements of 1600-100 U per day. Besides her diabetes, she had a history of pain and stiffness affecting numerous muscle groups, and hospitalization was required for pain control. The diagnosis of stiff-man syndrome (SMS) was confirmed with high titers of glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 antibodies in both serum and cerebral spinal fluid. In summary, we describe the first patient with type 1 diabetes, SMS, and severe insulin resistance. Although the etiology of the insulin resistance is unknown, due to the efficacious response to insulin lispro, hydrocortisone, and perhaps octreotide, we propose an immune-mediated etiology. Although rare, this syndrome needs to be considered as an etiology of insulin resistance.

AB  - Stiff-man syndrome (SMS) is characterized by fluctuating muscular rigidity and spasm. Recently, antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of y-amino butyric acid (GABA), have been detected in SMS patients. An autoimmune mechanism against GAD was thus proposed for the suppression of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons, resulting in rigidity and spasm. We conducted quantitative investigations on the ventral horn of the spinal cord and its GAD immunoreactivity, post mortem, in a SMS patient and four controls. In the spinal cord of the SMS patient, we found a 70%, 33% and 27% reduction (P < 0.05) in the density of neurons with somal areas of 1000-1500 microm2, 500-1000 microm2, and 0-500 microm2, respectively. The density of neurons with a somal area greater than 1500 microm2 was not reduced, although some neurons in this class showed central chromatolytic changes. The affected muscles exhibited neurogenic atrophy. GAD-like immunoreactivity in the spinal gray matter was not significantly decreased. The density of Purkinje cells, known to contain high amounts of GAD, was not significantly reduced. While the co-occurrence of elevation of anti-GAD antibody in the serum and reduction in the density of small spinal neurons was confirmed, that of smaller alpha-motor neurons and gamma-motor neurons, the qualitative changes in larger alpha-motor neurons, and the preservation of spinal GAD-like immunoreactivity and non-spinal GAD-containing neurons suggest the involvement of factors other than autoimmune mechanisms through anti-GAD antibodies. More diverse mechanisms may be associated in the pathogenesis of SMS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stiff-man syndrome is a rare neurological disorder characterised by rigidity and violent spasms of the body musculature. In the majority of patients, presence of antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the enzyme synthesizing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), suggests an autoimmune attack against GABA-ergic inhibitory neurons. We report a 32-year-old patient with stiff-man syndrome and anti-GAD antibodies who developed subacute progressive loss of vision in the right eye, and in the left eye 18 months thereafter., METHODS: Ophthalmological work-up included electro-retinogram (ERG), visual evoked potentials (VEP) and fluorescein angiography. Antiretinal antibodies were investigated using an indirect immunofluorescence technique on frozen sections of macaque retina with patients serum and FITC-conjugated goat antihuman immunoglobulin. Staining with monoclonal anti-GAD65 antibodies and with serum from three healthy normals served as controls., RESULTS: Visual acuity of both eyes decreased to 0.16 within a span of 6 weeks. Perimetry revealed a central scotoma in the visual field of both eyes. VEP and flash ERG were progressively disturbed on the right eye. On the left eye, initially only pattern ERG and photopic responses were abnormal. Follow-up recordings revealed widespread pathology of photopic single and flicker responses. Immunofluorescence revealed strong reactivity of the inner plexiform layer and to a lesser extent staining of the outer plexiform layer at dilutions of 1:1000 with patients serum. The same retinal staining pattern was obtained with monoclonal anti-GAD65 antibodies., CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest autoimmune retinopathy, mediated by anti-GAD65 autoantibodies as the underlying cause of visual loss.

AB  - GAD65 (glutamic acid decarboxylase) is an important autoantigen in both type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and the neurological autoimmune disease stiff-man syndrome (SMS), and is expressed in pancreatic islets as well as the nervous system. Still, only 30% of SMS patients also have type 1 diabetes. To study regulation of T cell responsiveness to GAD65, we investigated a non-diabetic SMS patient with HLA-DR3/7 (predisposing to type 1 diabetes) and high levels of type 1 diabetes-associated autoantibodies against GAD65 and islet cells, and compared the results with those of her diabetic son and two other SMS patients. T cell responses to GAD65 were repeatedly absent in primary stimulation, whereas IA-2, islet antigen and tetanus toxoid induced significant T cell proliferation. However, after in vitro restimulation, GAD65 reactive T cell lines and clones were obtained that were HLA-DR3 restricted, and cross-reactive with a homogenate of purified human pancreatic islets. These T cells produced the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10 in combination with IFN-gamma and IL-4 (Th0). The dominant T cell epitope was mapped to the central region of GAD65. Although no primary response to whole GAD65 was detectable, the naturally processed GAD65 peptide epitope was recognized vigorously in the primary stimulation assay. The lack of detectable primary T cell responses to GAD65, together with the GAD65-specific cytokine production of restimulated T cells, suggest that GAD65-specific cellular autoimmunity in this patient is suppressed and may be related to the absence of diabetes despite humoral autoreactivity and genetic predisposition.

AB  - The stiff-person syndrome, a rare and disabling disorder, is characterized by muscle rigidity and episodic spasms that involve axial and limb musculature. Continuous contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles caused by involuntary motor-unit firing at rest are the hallmark clinical and electrophysiologic signs of the disease. Except for global muscle stiffness, results of neurologic examination are usually normal. Results of conventional computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain are also normal. The cause of the stiff-person syndrome is unknown; however, an autoimmune pathogenesis is suspected because of 1) the presence of antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA); 2) the association of the disease with other autoimmune conditions; 3) the presence of various autoantibodies; and 4) a strong immunogenetic association. Anti-GAD antibodies, which are found in high titers in most patients, seem to be directed against conformational forms of GAD. New evidence suggests that these antibodies may be pathogenic because they interfere with the synthesis of GABA. In addition, a reduction in brain levels of GABA, which is prominent in the motor cortex, has been demonstrated with magnetic resonance spectroscopy in patients with the stiff-person syndrome. The stiff-person syndrome is clinically elusive but potentially treatable and should be considered in patients with unexplained stiffness and spasms. Drugs that enhance GABA neurotransmission, such as diazepam, vigabatrin, and baclofen, provide mild to modest relief of clinical symptoms. Immunomodulatory agents, such as steroids, plasmapheresis, and intravenous immunoglobulin, seem to offer substantial improvement. Results of an ongoing controlled trial will elucidate the role of these agents in the treatment of the disease.

AB  - The stiff-man syndrome is a rare neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive rigidity, stiffness, and intermittent spasm of axial and extremity muscles. Its etiology is unknown. Different therapeutic regimens have been used with variable success. We present a case of refractory stiff-man syndrome, in which the symptoms were successfully controlled by the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). This case gives evidence that IVIg can be a safe and an efficient treatment of refractory stiff-man syndrome. The exact indication for and the cost-effectiveness of IVIg in the treatment of this rare entity remain to be determined.

AB  - We report the effects of double filtration plasma exchange and immunoadsorption therapy which were performed for a case of stiff-man syndrome even though the patient was negative for anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody. The patient underwent a course of four double filtration plasma exchanges, which resulted in marked clinical improvement. Painful muscle cramps disappeared and muscle stiffness reduced within a day after the first plasma exchange. The patient's improvement continued, but his condition declined again about ten months after plasma exchange. Immunoadsorption therapy was then performed, and this treatment was also effective.

AB  - The clinical and neurophysiological findings in a patient with a typical stiff-man syndrome and their three-year evolution are described. The patient had high titers of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain and spinal cord was normal. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) revealed a distinctive motor evoked potential (MEP) pattern in proximal lower limb muscles consisting of markedly increased MEP amplitudes and MEP/M ratios, reduced excitability thresholds, and absent silent period. However, MEP latencies, central and peripheral conduction times and amplitudes obtained by magnetic spinal root stimulation were normal. Treatment with benzodiazepine and baclofen normalized both the clinical picture and the MEP values. TMS may be useful both as a diagnostic tool and to monitor the response to drug treatment.

AB  - Stiff-Man syndrome (SMS) is a rare disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by chronic rigidity, spasms, and autoimmunity directed against synaptic antigens, most often the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). In a subset of cases, SMS has an autoimmune paraneoplastic origin. We report here the identification of high-titer autoantibodies directed against gephyrin in a patient with clinical features of SMS and mediastinal cancer. Gephyrin is a cytosolic protein selectively concentrated at the postsynaptic membrane of inhibitory synapses, where it is associated with GABA(A) and glycine receptors. Our findings provide new evidence for a close link between autoimmunity directed against components of inhibitory synapses and neurological conditions characterized by chronic rigidity and spasms.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical spectrum of anti-GAD-positive patients with stiff-person syndrome (SPS) and provide reproducible means of assessing stiffness., BACKGROUND: SPS can be difficult to diagnose. Delineation of the clinical spectrum in a well defined population will increase diagnostic sensitivity., METHODS: In 20 anti-GAD-positive patients with SPS (six men, 14 women), screened among 38 referred patients, the authors assessed symptoms and signs, degree of disability, associated conditions, and immunogenetic markers. Degree of bending, distribution of stiff areas, timed activities, and magnitude of heightened sensitivity were examined monthly for 4 months in five patients., RESULTS: Average age at symptom onset was 41.2 years. Time to diagnosis was delayed from 1 to 18 years (mean 6.2). Stiffness with superimposed episodic spasms and co-contractures of the abdominal and thoracic paraspinal muscles were characteristic. All had stiff gait and palpable stiffness in the paraspinal muscles. Stiffness was asymmetric or prominent in one leg in 15 patients (stiff-leg syndrome) and involved facial muscles in 13. In one patient spasms lasted for days (status spasticus). Twelve patients needed a cane and seven a walker due to truncal stiffness and frequent falls (average three to four per month). Distribution of stiffness and degree of heightened sensitivity were two reproducible indices of stiffness and spasms. Autoimmune diseases or autoantibodies were noted in 80% and an association of with DRss(1) 0301 allele in 70%., CONCLUSIONS: SPS is 1) frequently misdiagnosed due to multifaceted presentations and asymmetric signs, 2) disabling if untreated, and 3) associated with other autoimmune conditions.

AB  - A patient with long-standing, occult pituitary insufficiency, who developed painful muscle stiffness and superimposed spasms, closely resembling stiff-person syndrome, was described. Complete resolution of neuromuscular symptoms with hormone replacement in this case, as well as in a previously reported one, led to the suggestion that a syndrome like stiff-person could represent a rare consequence of multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-Ab) are described in patients with insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes mellitus (IDDM), in stiff-man syndrome, and, recently, in a few patients with cerebellar ataxia., OBJECTIVES: To show a link between GAD-Ab and some patients with cerebellar ataxia and to clarify their clinical and immunologic profiles., METHODS: Serum samples were selected from 9000 samples of 4 laboratories. The selection criterion was an immunohistochemical pattern compatible with GAD-Ab that was confirmed by radioimmunoassay. We identified 22 patients with stiff-man syndrome and 14 with cerebellar ataxia and GAD-Ab., RESULTS: Thirteen of the 14 patients with cerebellar ataxia and GAD-Ab were women, and 11 had late-onset IDDM. Patients did not have clinical or radiologic evidence of brainstem involvement. Ten patients had oligoclonal IgG bands in the cerebrospinal fluid, and intrathecal GAD-Ab synthesis was observed in 5 of the 6 patients studied. The level of GAD-Ab of these patients was similar to those with stiff-man syndrome and significantly higher than those with IDDM or with polyendocrine autoimmunity (P<.001). However, the GAD-Ab levels of 6 of the 9 patients with polyendocrine autoimmunity overlapped with those of patients with cerebellar ataxia., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a link between high level of GAD-Ab and some cases of cerebellar ataxia, particularly women with IDDM. If high serum levels of GAD-Ab are detected, the cerebrospinal fluid should be evaluated for the presence of oligoclonal IgG bands and intrathecal synthesis of GAD-Ab to further prove an autoimmune origin of the syndrome.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a disorder of motor function characterized by rigidity of axial musculature and fluctuating painful spasms, which are often induced by startle or emotional stimuli. Neurophysiological studies have demonstrated the presence of continuous motor unit activity in muscle at rest, with abnormally enhanced extereoceptive reflexes. Although criteria for the diagnosis of SPS were proposed, several variants of this syndrome have been described before. In this communication, we report the case of a patient with a focal form of SPS. A 39-year-old woman developed progressive instability in her gait, spasms and stiffness restricted to both legs. The electromyographic examination showed continuous motor unit activity of the affected muscles at rest. Moreover, high anti-GAD antibodies titers were found in CSF and serum. Clinical symptoms, electrophysiological and immunological profiles suggest a focal form of SPS. Clinical and immunological findings indicate that SPS is a heterogeneous disease, suggesting the need to redefine its diagnostic criteria. Definition of the range of clinical expression and immunological profiles could be important for the clinical management of these patients.

AB  - Stiff-man syndrome (STS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by involuntary axial and proximal limb rigidity and continuous motor unit activity on electromyography (EMG). Autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) present in 60% of the patients are implicated. We report on the use of plasma exchange (PE) in 2 patients with STS whose serum and cerebrospinal fluid were negative for GAD autoantibodies. One patient showed minimal clinical improvement following PE while the second reported subjective improvement, but not any different from that with medications. Based on the results of PE in our patients, it seems that those who are autoantibody negative are less likely to respond. Whether a more aggressive approach to PE will be beneficial remains speculative.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare, chronic disorder characterized by painful spasm and stiffness. We investigated the quality of life (QoL) in SPS patients, and identified factors associated with impairment in patients' QoL. Twenty-four SPS patients (10 men, 14 women; mean age +/- S.D., 52.6 +/- 9.5 years) completed the medical outcomes study Short Form health survey (SF-36), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and a questionnaire asking for sociodemographic and clinical details. Extent of the disease was assessed using a distribution of stiffness score. SPS patients showed markedly reduced mean scores for all dimensions of the SF-36 when compared to norms from the general population of the United Kingdom. QoL scores showed a strong correlation with the extent of the disease. Depression was a common finding; 14 of 24 patients had depressive symptoms as evidenced by the BDI. There was a significant and strong correlation between the BDI score and several SF-36 subscores. This is the first study to address QoL in patients with SPS. We have shown that SPS has a significant impact on patients' reported QoL. The association between depression and QoL highlights the importance of recognizing and treating depression in SPS.

AB  - The stiff-person syndrome is a rare and disabling disorder, characterized by muscle rigidity with superimposed painful spasms involving axial and limb musculature. The clinical symptoms are continuous contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles caused by involuntary motor-unit firing at rest and the spasms that are precipitated by tactile stimuli, passive strach, volitional movement of affected or unaffected muscles, startling noises and emotional stimuli. Both the rigidity and the spasms are relieved by sleep, general anaesthesia, myoneural blockade and peripheral nerve blockade. The cause of the stiff-person syndrome is unknown but an autoimmune pathogenesis is suspected because 1) the presence in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of the inhibitory neurotrasmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), 2) the association of the disease with other autoimmune disorders, 3) the presence of various autoantibodies and 4) a strong immunogenetic association. The stiff-person syndrome is clinically elusive but potentially treatable and should be considered in patients with unexplained stiffness and spasms. Drugs that enhance GABA neurotransmission, such as diazepam, vigabatrin and baclofen, provide modest relief of clinical symptoms. Immunomodulatory agents such as steroids, plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin, seem to offer substantial improvement.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate systematically the rate and type of phobia in stiff man syndrome and its variants, and to compare patients with stiff man syndrome with and without phobia for sociodemographic and neurological characteristics., METHODS: 43 consecutive patients with stiff man syndrome referred to a university department of neurology were assessed using the anxiety disorders interview schedule, revised (ADIS-R), a structured diagnostic interview for anxiety disorders, in addition to a full clinical neurological and psychiatric assessment., RESULTS: 19 patients (44.2%) developed task specific phobia--that is, fear and avoidance of situations difficult to master owing to the motor symptoms of stiff man syndrome (such as crossing streets). Three further patients (7%) had subthreshold phobia--that is, phobic anxiety without avoidance. There were no significant differences between patients with and without phobia in terms of age, illness duration, type of stiff man syndrome, antibody status, or frequency of falls. Patients with phobia were more likely to present with exaggerated startle responses and to have an initial misdiagnosis of psychogenic movement disorder., CONCLUSIONS: Specific phobia is a frequent non-motor symptom of stiff man syndrome. Early recognition is an important aid to correct diagnosis. The aetiology of phobia in stiff man syndrome is unknown. There is no evidence of a direct pathogenic role of autoantibodies directed against glutamic acid decarboxylase in the development of phobia.

AB  - We conducted the current review of the paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes (PNSs) associated with gynecologic and breast carcinomas to describe their clinical and immunologic characteristics and their relative frequency. We retrospectively reviewed 92 patients whose serum was sent to our laboratories to detect onconeural antibodies and who were diagnosed as having PNSs associated with breast or gynecologic tumors. PNSs were defined as "definitive" and "possible" (atypical PNS, no onconeural antibodies, and no improvement after tumor treatment). Forty-nine patients had breast and 43 had gynecologic cancer. Sixty-three patients had onconeural antibodies (50 Yo-ab, 5 Hu-ab, 5 Ri-ab, and 3 amphiphysin-ab). Cerebellar ataxia represented 57 (62%) of all PNSs and was associated with anti-Yo in 88%. All Yo-abnegative patients had breast cancer; 4 of them had a mild cerebellar syndrome that improved after tumor treatment. Sensorypredominant neuropathies were present in 17 (18%) patients. Seven of them had Hu-ab (5) or amphiphysin-ab (2). Other PNSs were opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (4 cases, Ri-ab in 2), sensorimotor neuropathy (4 cases), paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis (4 cases, Ri-ab in 3), paraneoplastic retinopathy (2 cases), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (2 cases), stiff-person syndrome (1 with amphiphysin-ab), and limbic encephalitis (1 case). All patients with gynecologic cancer presented definitive PNS, and onconeural antibodies were diagnosed in 93% of them. In contrast, 20% of PNSs associated with breast cancer were defined as possible and the incidence of onconeural antibodies was 51%, excluding the 2 patients with paraneoplastic retinopathy in whom antiretinal antibodies were not analyzed. In patients with possible PNS, a coincidental association between the tumor and the neurologic disorder cannot be excluded.

AB  - Intrathecal baclofen (ITB) is used for unresponsiveness to other treatment for patients with stiff-person syndrome (SPS). The authors report a patient with SPS who developed acute and life-threatening baclofen withdrawal symptoms. Open surgery disclosed a small position-dependent leak in the catheter connector. This catheter failure was not detected by standard noninvasive checking methods.

AB  - The authors report a 71-year-old woman with amphiphysin-associated paraneoplastic stiff-person syndrome, opsoclonus, and encephalopathy. The patient's symptoms temporarily responded to plasmapheresis in parallel with a decline of serum anti-amphiphysin antibody titers. Later, the encephalopathy progressed rapidly and the patient died. Binding studies and the detection of autoantibodies in the patient's CNS as well as the treatment response suggest a pathogenic role of the anti-amphiphysin antibodies.

AU  - Berger, Christian

AB  - The head retraction reflex (HRR) is a vestigial withdrawal reflex of the face and is suppressed in healthy subjects. We investigated the prevalence and electrophysiological patterns of the HRR in patients suffering from stiff-man syndrome (SMS, n = 28) and related disorders, stiff-limb syndrome (SLS, n = 2), and progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM, n = 20). In patients with a positive HRR, the electromyographic (EMG) pattern was analyzed with surface recordings from the orbicularis oculi, sternocleidomastoid, trapezius, and the paraspinal extensor muscles at midthoracic and lumbar levels. On clinical testing, 17 of 28 SMS patients, 10 of 20 PERM patients, and 0 of 2 SLS patients had a positive HRR, ranging from a brief contraction of the neck extensors to violent retropulsion of the upper body. In all muscles, EMG reflex patterns elicited by gentle taps to the face or by electrical stimulation of the trigeminal nerve branches consisted of two components: an early, synchronous, brief burst with the shortest latency in trapezius (12.5-20.0 msec) and a late, asynchronous, longer response with latencies between 44 and 70 msec. We conclude that the HRR is an abnormal cutaneomuscular brainstem reflex that occurs in a considerable proportion of patients with SMS and related disorders. Although neither specific nor particularly sensitive for SMS, presence of the HRR in a setting with otherwise unexplained stiffness and spasms might help to avoid the otherwise frequent misdiagnosis of a psychogenic motor disturbance in patients with SMS.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a chronic autoimmune disease associated with humoral and cellular immune responses to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65. Another chronic autoimmune disease, type 1 diabetes (T1D), is also associated with autoimmune responses to this antigen, but T1D patients develop SPS only extremely rarely and only a third of SPS patients develop T1D (mostly mild manifestations in adulthood). In a previous study, we described important differences between T1D and SPS in the autoimmune response to GAD 65: (1) T cells of SPS patients recognize epitopes in the middle of GAD 65 (amino residues 81-171 and 313-403), whereas patients with T1D preferentially recognize another middle (161-243) and a C-terminal region (473-555); and (2) GAD antibodies (Abs) were nearly exclusively of the Th1-associated IgG1 type in T1D, whereas SPS patients had both Th1- and Th2-associated IgG4 and IgE GAD Abs. These differences were not simply related to different HLA alleles. Fine epitope mapping revealed further distinct T cell epitopes in both diseases despite similar HLA background. Therefore, a single autoantigen can elicit different immune responses causing distinct chronic autoimmune diseases possibly related to a Th1 or Th2 bias of the disease.

AB  - Stiff-Man syndrome (SMS) is a rare disease of the central nervous system characterized by chronic muscle rigidity and autoimmunity directed against synaptic antigens. In a subset of patients, generally positive for antiamphiphysin autoantibodies, SMS has an autoimmune paraneoplastic origin. Amphiphysin isoforms are expressed at high levels in brain and skeletal muscle and often are overexpressed in breast cancer. We report here the occurrence of rhabdomyolysis in a patient with SMS, breast cancer, and antibodies that recognize both brain and muscle amphiphysin isoforms. Immunotherapy induced a remission of both rhabdomyolysis and SMS symptoms. Autoimmune rhabdomyolysis may represent a paraneoplastic complication of cancer patients with amphiphysin autoimmunity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: S: To investigate whether motor cortex excitability is enhanced in both stiff-person syndrome (SPS) and its "plus" variant, progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity (PER), and related to autoimmunity against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)., METHODS: The authors compared 21 patients with SPS or PER (7 untreated, 14 treated) with 14 age-matched healthy controls and used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS, paired-pulse paradigm) to investigate intracortical inhibition (ICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF). GAD autoantibody levels in serum and CSF were determined by radioimmunoassay., RESULTS: The authors found significantly enhanced motor cortex excitability in untreated SPS and PER patients. GABAmimetic medication significantly reduced ICF but did not affect ICI. Motor cortex excitability was more enhanced in patients with GAD antibodies than in patients without GAD antibodies and correlated positively with GAD antibody levels in CSF., CONCLUSIONS: The motor cortex is hyperexcitable in SPS and PER patients. However, hyperexcitability is partly masked by GABAmimetic treatment. Correlation of elevated GAD antibody levels with enhanced ICF suggests that motor cortex hyperexcitability in SPS and PER is related to anti-GAD autoimmunity.

AB  - The aim of the present study is to identify the range of neurological disorders expressing antineuronal antibodies, evaluate the number of different patterns of reactivity that can be detected, and analyse the contribution of these studies to the identification of subgroups of patients. The records of 882 patients were reviewed and their sera and cerebrospinal fluids tested for antineuronal antibodies. Patients were initially divided into four groups according to suspected clinical diagnosis. Autoantibodies were detected by immunohistochemistry, Western blot of gradient-separated neuronal and recombinant proteins and by RIA. Cerebellar degeneration and sensory neuropathies were the most common neurological disorders in which paraneoplastic-related anti-neuronal antibodies were detected. However, in addition to PCA1/anti-Yo and ANNA1/anti-Hu antibodies, we found other reactivities in six patients with cerebellar degeneration: anti-GAD in three females and atypical in the other cases. The widest range of different anti-neuronal antibodies was detected in patients with peripheral sensory neuropathy. Few patients with Stiff-Person syndrome, temporal lobe epilepsy and myoclonus harboured anti-GAD antibodies. Atypical antibodies were detected in single cases with motor neuron disorder and multiple system atrophy. No anti-neuronal antibodies were detected in patients with neurological complications of connective tissue disorders other than Sjogren's syndrome, or in neurological diseases other than motor neuron disease and multiple system atrophy. Our study shows that the spectrum of neurological disorders in which anti-neuronal antibodies can be detected is wider than previously thought. In addition, we found patterns of neuronal staining and Western blot reactivity that differed from those so far reported. This may permit identification of subgroups of patients in whom strategies directed at removing and/or suppressing antibody production could be of some benefit.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is an immune-mediated central nervous system disorder characterized by fluctuating muscle stiffness, disabling spasms, and heightened sensitivity to external stimuli. Up to 80% of patients with SPS have anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies in the serum or cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). Whether these antibodies are clinically relevant and correlate with disease severity is unknown., OBJECTIVE: To correlate anti-GAD antibody titers in the serum and CSF of patients with SPS with the degree of clinical severity., DESIGN: Patients studied the last 6 years., SETTING: The Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD., PATIENTS: Sixteen patients with typical SPS and elevated serum anti-GAD antibody titers., INTERVENTIONS: Antibody titers in serum and CSF were measured by radioimmunoassay, and the intrathecal anti-GAD-specific IgG production was calculated., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparison of antibody titers with stiffness index and heightened sensitivity scores based on scales that reliably measure disease severity., RESULTS: The mean disease duration was 11 years (range, 5-30 years). The mean anti-GAD antibody titer in the serum was 51 500 U/mL (range, 24 000-200 000 U/mL); and in the CSF, 181 U/mL (range, 30-400 U/mL). A 10-fold increased intrathecal production of GAD-specific IgG antibodies was noted. No correlation was found between antibody titers in serum or CSF with disease severity. In 4 patients, the anti-GAD antibody titers measured serially during a 2-year period did not correlate with clinical fluctuations., CONCLUSIONS: In patients with SPS, the anti-GAD antibody titers in serum and CSF do not correlate with disease severity or duration. Anti-GAD antibodies are an excellent marker for SPS, but monitoring their titers during the course of the disease may not be of practical value.

AB  - We report an unusual case of primary hypothalamic lymphoma with hypopituitarism presenting as Stiff-man syndrome (SMS). A 64-year-old man was hospitalized due to a 3-week history of general weakness, anorexia, vomiting, weight loss, and muscle pain and spasms precipitated by motion and tactile stimuli resulting in muscle stiffness and difficulty in mobility. Physical examination revealed normal sensorimotor function and reflexes, except for bitemporal visual field defect. Routine laboratory and gastrointestinal examinations provided no remarkable clues. Endocrine assessment revealed low levels of morning cortisol, thyroxine, and anterior pituitary hormones but an increase in prolactin level. The patient's muscle pain and stiffness improved dramatically within 2 days after hydrocortisone therapy and thyroxine replacement. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain confirmed an 18-mm enhancing hypothalamic tumor with optic chiasm involvement, which proved to be a B-cell lymphoma. The results of the extensive studies for systemic lymphoma were negative, suggesting a primary hypothalamic lymphoma. The tumor regressed completely and was invisible on MRI scan after adjuvant radiotherapy. The patient's condition was satisfactory and there was no recurrence of SMS during the 2-year follow-up period. This case demonstrated that primary hypothalamic lymphoma complicated with adrenal insufficiency may manifest as SMS. Early diagnosis and prompt intervention can lead to a favorable outcome and reduce morbidity.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Hyperekplexia and the stiff-man syndrome (SMS) are both conditions with exaggerated startle suggesting abnormal brainstem function. Investigation of brainstem reflexes may provide insight into disturbed reflex excitation and inhibition underlying these movement disorders., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using four-channel EMG, we examined four trigeminal brainstem reflexes (monosynaptic masseter, masseter inhibitory, glabella, and orbicularis oculi blink reflexes) and their spread into pericranial muscles in five patients with familial hyperekplexia (FH), two with acquired hyperekplexia (AH), 10 with SMS, and 15 healthy control subjects., RESULTS: Both FH/AH and SMS patients had abnormal propagation of brainstem reflexes into pericranial muscles. All patients with hyperekplexia showed an abnormal short-latency (15-20 ms) reflex in the trapezius muscle with a characteristic clinical appearance ("head retraction jerk") evoked by tactile or electrical stimulation of the trigeminal nerve, but normal monosynaptic masseter reflexes. Inhibitory brainstem reflexes were attenuated in some FH/AH patients. Four of 10 patients with SMS had similar short-latency reflexes in the neck muscles and frequently showed widespread enhancement of other excitatory reflexes, reflex spasms, and attenuation of inhibitory brainstem reflexes., CONCLUSION: Reflex excitation is exaggerated and inhibition is attenuated in both stiff-man syndrome and familial or acquired hyperekplexia, indicating a physiological relationship. Reflex transmission in the brainstem appears biased towards excitation which may imply dysfunction of inhibitory glycinergic or GABAergic interneurons, or both.

AB  - Five hundred seventy-six patients with suspected stiff-person syndrome (SPS) underwent immunocytochemistry (ICC). Of these, 286 underwent radioimmunoassay (RIA) for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies; 116 were GAD antibody positive by one or both tests. Ninety-six percent of those positive by ICC had RIA values several standard deviations above normal. RIA did not correlate with age or illness duration. Marked elevations of RIA for GAD antibodies were characteristic of ICC-confirmed SPS, and modest elevations were not.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with stiff-person syndrome (SPS) have circulating antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for the synthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Although the patients' symptoms of stiffness and unexpected spasms can be explained on the basis of reduced or impaired inhibitory neurotransmitters, such as GABA, it is unclear whether the level of GABA in the brains of these patients is reduced and, if so, whether the reduction is due to anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies., OBJECTIVE: To measure GABA levels in the brains of patients with SPS., DESIGN: Prospective case-control study., SETTING: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., PATIENTS: Eight patients with SPS with high titers of circulating anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies and typical clinical symptoms of SPS and 16 control subjects., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of brain magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which measures GABA levels in specific brain regions., RESULTS: No abnormalities were noted on brain magnetic resonance images. A prominent and significant decrease in GABA level was, however, observed in the sensorimotor cortex and a smaller decrease in the posterior occipital cortex but not in the cingulate cortex or pons., CONCLUSIONS: The reduction of brain GABA in patients with SPS supports the clinical symptoms and indicates that the inhibitory GABAergic pathways are involved in the disease. Regardless of the responsible autoantigens, in SPS autoantibodies block the function of GABAergic neurons and interfere with the synthesis of GABA but do not cause structural changes in the brain.

TI  - The role of IVIg in the treatment of patients with stiff person syndrome and other neurological diseases associated with anti-GAD antibodies.
AU  - Dalakas, Marinos C
PY  - 2005
PD  - /
AB  - INTRODUCTION: High-titre anti-GAD antibodies are characteristically seen in patients with stiff person syndrome (SPS). Other CNS disorders, rarely associated with high anti-GAD antibody titres, include: a) SPS-plus, a syndrome characterised by SPS and cerebellar ataxia; b) Batten's disease; and c) rare patients with epilepsy and idiopathic cerebellar ataxia. Currently, high-titre anti- GAD antibodies serve only as markers of an autoimmune process within the CNS because their pathogenic role in the afore-mentioned disorders has not been established. In SPS, there is evidence of autoimmune pathogenesis based on: the association of the disease with other autoimmune disorders or autoantibodies; immunogenetic background; presence of oligoclonal IgG bands in the CSF with increased intrathecal anti-GAD antibody synthesis and response to immunotherapies. SPS is the only GAD-positive CNS disease where a controlled study with immunotherapy has been conducted., METHODS: Sixteen anti-GAD antibody-positive patients were randomised to receive IVIg or placebo for 3 months. After a washout, they crossed to the alternative therapy for another three months. Efficacy was based on the difference in scores of the distribution of stiffness index and heightened sensitivity (spasms) from baseline to the second and third month of the infusions. Direct treatment and carry-over effect were compared for both groups., RESULTS: The stiffness scores in the IVIg-randomised patients declined significantly from month 1 through 4, but rebounded when they crossed to placebo. In contrast, the scores in the placebo-randomised group remained constant from month 1-4 but dropped significantly after crossing to IVIg. Eleven patients who received IVIg became able to walk unassisted, stopped falling and assumed household or work duties. The duration of benefit varied from 6-12 weeks or up to a year. The anti-GAD(65) antibody titres declined after IVIg, but not after placebo., CONCLUSION: Based on a controlled study, IVIg is a safe and effective therapy for SPS in patients unresponsive to other agents. Whether IVIg has a role in the other GAD-positive patients with neurological disease, or in SPS patients without GAD antibodies, remains unknown.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome is a rare, likely immune-mediated neurological disorder characterized by painful spasms and progressive symmetric rigidity of the axial and proximal limb muscles. Rigidity of truncal muscles and continuous contraction of the agonist and antagonist muscles caused by involuntary motor-unit firing at rest are the hallmarks of stiff-person syndrome. Immunosuppressive therapy has induced remission in patients with stiff-person syndrome. We report a patient with stiff-person syndrome with minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS). The pathophysiologic states of stiff-person syndrome and MCNS are unclear. T-Cell-dependent mechanisms are highly suspected for the pathogenesis of both. The diagnosis of stiff-person syndrome was made on the basis of clinical and laboratory findings, and both MCNS and stiff-person syndrome resolved completely with immunosuppressive therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first case of stiff-person syndrome in association with MCNS in the literature.

AB  - Amphiphysin-IgG was identified in 71 patients among 120,000 evaluated serologically for paraneoplastic autoantibodies. Clinical information was available for 63 patients. Cancer was detected in 50 (mostly limited), proven histologically in 46, and was imaged intrathoracically in 4 patients (lung, small-cell [27] and non-small cell [1]), breast [16] and melanoma [2]). Neurological accompaniments included (decreasing frequency): neuropathy, encephalopathy, myelopathy, stiff-man phenomena, and cerebellar syndrome. In a case examined neuropathologically, parenchymal T-lymphocyte infiltration (predominantly CD8(+)) was prominent in lower brainstem, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglion. Coexisting paraneoplastic autoantibodies, identified in 74% of patients, predicted a common neoplasm and indicated other neuronal autoantigen targets that plausibly explained several neurological manifestations; for example, P/Q-type Ca(2+)-channel antibody with Lambert-Eaton syndrome (n = 5), anti-neuronal nuclear antibody type 1 with sensory neuronopathy (n = 7), K(+)-channel antibody with limbic encephalitis (n = 1) or neuromyotonia (n = 1), and collapsin response-mediator protein-5-IgG with optic neuritis (n = 3). Patients with isolated amphiphysin-IgG (n = 19) were more likely to be women (with breast cancer, p < 0.05) and to have myelopathy or stiff-man phenomena (p < 0.01). Overall, a minority of women (39%) and men (12%) had stiff-man phenomena. Only 10% of women (some with lung carcinoma) and 4% of men fulfilled diagnostic criteria for stiff-man syndrome.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report an association between two autoimmune conditions, Graves' disease and stiff-person (stiff-man) syndrome, and discuss the relevant literature., METHODS: We present a case of a 52-year-old white woman with stiff-person syndrome who also had Graves' disease, discuss her management, and review the related literature. Pertinent published reports from 1950 through 2004 were researched with use of MEDLINE and PubMed, and cross-references to other articles were reviewed., RESULTS: A 52-year-old white woman presented with symptoms of hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease. Laboratory data were as follows: thyrotropin <0.005 m IU/mL, thyroxine 11.1 microg/dL, free thyroxine index (FTI) 10.7, and triiodothyronine 170 ng/dL. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI) and thyrotropin-binding inhibitory immunoglobulins (TBII) were positive at 1,986% and 82.5 U/L, respectively. The hyperthyroidism was treated with propranolol. She had a long-standing history of musculoskeletal complaints and was ultimately diagnosed with stiff-person syndrome. During her thyroid evaluation, she had severe neurologic deterioration that necessitated hospitalization and treatment with clonazepam, baclofen, intravenous immunoglobulin, and subsequently prednisone and azathioprine for appreciable symptomatic relief. The aggressive immunosuppression had a profound effect on her symptoms of hyperthyroidism, results of thyroid function tests, and thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRABs). Thyrotropin was 0.52 microIU/mL, thyroxine was 6.9 microg/dL, and FTI was 5.7. The TSI decreased from 1,986% to 248%, and her TBII normalized from 82.5 U/L to <5 U/L. She was clinically and biochemically euthyroid at last follow-up in May 2004., CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the association between TRAB-positive Graves' disease and stiff-person syndrome and the improvement of Graves' disease with immunosuppressive therapy.

AB  - PURPOSE: To report the ophthalmic findings and response to treatment in a patient with glutamic-acid decarboxylase antibodies., DESIGN: Case report., METHODS: A 55-year-old woman developed progressive, painful, low back muscle spasms, vertical diplopia, downbeating nystagmus, and asymmetric appendicular ataxia., RESULTS: Downbeating nystagmus was present in primary gaze with an alternating skew deviation in lateral gaze. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid GAD antibodies were detected. Treatment with diazepam led to resolution of spasticity, whereas repeated courses of intravenous immunoglobulin improved cerebellar function, including appendicular ataxia and downbeating nystagmus., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with GAD antibodies may have elements of both Stiff-person syndrome (muscle rigidity and spasms) and prominent cerebellar dysfunction. Treatment with diazepam rapidly improved Stiff-person symptoms, whereas IVIg was partially effective at the early stage of cerebellar dysfunction.

AB  - Stiff-man syndrome is a rare disorder of the central nervous system of unknown pathogenesis. We have previously reported the presence of autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) in a patient with stiff-man syndrome, epilepsy, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. GAD is an enzyme selectively concentrated in neurons secreting the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and in pancreatic beta cells. We subsequently observed autoantibodies to GABA-ergic neurons in 20 of 33 patients with stiff-man syndrome. GAD was the principal autoantigen. In the group of patients positive for autoantibodies against GABA-ergic neurons, there was a striking association with organ-specific autoimmune diseases, primarily insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. These findings support the hypothesis that stiff-man syndrome is an autoimmune disease and suggest that GAD is the primary autoantigen involved in stiff-man syndrome and the associated insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Our findings also indicate that autoantibodies directed against GABA-ergic neurons are a useful marker in the diagnosis of the disease.

Isolated myelitis of lumbosacral segments of the spinal cord, apparently confined to the grey matter, was diagnosed and its spirochaetal aetiology confirmed by serology and CSF findings. Oligoclonal IgG bands in CSF specific for Borrelia burgdorferi were found. Thus, there is evidence that B. burgdorferi ist able to cause a localized myelitis, probably of spinal interneurons, presenting as a partial stiff man syndrome.

AB  - Two women with typical stiff-man syndrome (SMS) developed increasingly frequent attacks of muscle spasms with severe paroxysmal autonomic dysfunctions such as transient hyperpyrexia, diaphoresis, tachypnea, tachycardia, pupillary dilation, and arterial hypertension. Autoantibodies to GABA-ergic neurons were identified in the serum of both patients and in the cerebrospinal fluid of one. Both died suddenly and unexpectedly. General autopsy did not reveal the cause of death. Neuropathological studies revealed perivascular gliosis in the spinal cord and brain stem of one patient and lymphocytic perivascular infiltration in the spinal cord, brain stem, and basal ganglia of the other. The occurrence of a chronic inflammatory reaction in one of the two patients supports the idea that an autoimmune disease against GABA-ergic neurons may be involved in SMS. A review of the literature indicates that functional impairment in SMS is severe and prognosis is unpredictable because of the potential for sudden and unexpected death. Both muscular abnormalities and autonomic dysfunctions may result from autoimmunity directed against GABA-ergic neurons.

There was no evidence of ocular myasthenia, indicating that abnormalities of ocular motor function can occur as a primary manifestation of SPS, perhaps from depletion of GABA.

AB  - Autoantibodies to the 65-kDa isoform of glutamate decarboxylase GAD65 (GAD65Ab) are strong candidates for a pathological role in Stiff-Person syndrome (SPS). We have analyzed the binding specificity of the GAD65Ab in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 12 patients with SPS by competitive displacement studies with GAD65-specific rFab-derived from a number of human and mouse mAbs specific for different determinants on the Ag. We demonstrate considerable differences in the epitope specificity when comparing paired serum and CSF samples, suggesting local stimulation of B cells in the CSF compartment of these patients. Moreover, these autoantibodies strongly inhibit the enzymatic activity of GAD65, thus blocking the formation of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. The capacity of the sera to inhibit the enzymatic activity of GAD65 correlated with their binding to a conformational C-terminal Ab epitope. Investigation of the inhibitory mechanism revealed that the inhibition could not be overcome by high concentrations of glutamate or the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate, suggesting a noncompetitive inhibitory mechanism. Finally, we identified a linear epitope on amino acids residues 4-22 of GAD65 that was recognized solely by autoantibodies from patients with SPS but not by serum from type 1 diabetes patients. A mAb (N-GAD65 mAb) recognizing this N-terminal epitope was successfully humanized to enhance its potential therapeutic value by reducing its overall immunogenicity.

AB  - Controlled trials with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) were conducted in patients with Stiff-Person Syndrome (SPS) and dermatomyositis (DM), two humorally mediated neurological disorders, and in inclusion body myositis (IBM), a T-cell-mediated inflammatory myopathy. The clinical efficacy was compared with alterations on tissue expression of complement, cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and immunoregulatory genes. The following patients were randomized in three separate trials to receive IVIg or placebo for 3 mo: (a) 16 patients with anti-GAD antibody-positive SPS; (b) 15 patients with DM resistant to therapies; and (c) 19 patients with IBM. After a washout, they crossed to the alternative therapy for another 3 mo. Efficacy was based on the difference in the respective disease scores from baseline to the second and third month of the infusions. In patients with SPS and DM, the scores changed positively and significantly from months 1 through 3, but returned to baseline when the patients crossed to placebo. In contrast, the scores in the placebo-randomized group remained constant or worsened from months 1 to 3, but improved significantly after crossing to IVIg. The muscle scores of patients with IBM did not significantly change between IVIg or placebo. In SPS, the anti-GAD65 antibody titers declined after IVIg but not after placebo. In DM, there was reduction of complement consumption, interception of membranolytic attack complex formation, downregulation of inflammation, fibrosis, cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules, and alterations in thousands of immunoregulatory genes. We conclude that IVIg is a safe and effective therapy for patients with SPS and DM unresponsive to other agents. In tissues, IVIg restores tissue cytoarchitecture by suppressing the inflammatory mediators at the protein, mRNA, and gene level.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with Stiff-Person Syndrome (SPS) typically show stiffness and spasms, primarily of the trunk and proximal lower extremities. The purpose of this case report is to provide an overview of SPS and a description of the specific physical therapy management strategies used during a brief inpatient rehabilitation stay for a patient with SPS, illustrating the use of the patient/client management model in the Guide to Physical Therapist Practice., CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was a 33-year-old with a 3- year history of SPS. He spent 10 days in an in-patient rehabilitation hospital where he received physical therapy daily. The initial examination revealed impairments of pain, range of motion, reflex integrity, and motor function, along with abnormalities of posture, balance, and function. The procedural interventions included therapeutic exercise and functional retraining. Stretching exercises were categorized according to their priority and level of difficulty to accommodate for the patient's varying symptoms, and relaxation exercises aimed to reduce the severity of the patient's spasms. The functional retraining program included transfer and progressive gait training., OUTCOMES: The patient showed improvements in ankle range of motion, posture, and gait (distance, speed, and independence), despite continued problems with stiffness, spasms, and pain., DISCUSSION: Physical therapists working with patients with SPS have challenges related to the paucity of information in the literature. The chronic, progressive, and variable nature of SPS indicates the need for life-long management, with the inclusion of an exercise program that can be adjusted accordingly, given the frequently changing symptoms experienced by the patient. As is shown with this case, it appears that physical therapy can improve function and some of the impairments associated with SPS.

AB  - Stiff-Person Syndrome (SPS) is an immune-mediated disorder of the central nervous system characterized by muscle rigidity, episodic muscle spasms, and high titers of antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). The presence of cerebellar ataxia in SPS is extremely rare, but occurs. Clinical observations of ocular motor abnormalities have been noted in a few SPS patients. The purpose of this study is to provide a detailed quantitative documentation of ocular motor abnormalities in a patient with SPS and progressive cerebellar signs. Detailed clinical assessment of a woman with SPS and precise eye movement recordings using the magnetic search coil technique was performed. In addition to other ocular motor abnormalities that included longer latencies for saccades, downbeat nystagmus, and loss of downward smooth pursuit, a rare saccade velocity profile consisting of multi-component saccades was observed. We postulate that these ocular motor findings are related to impairment of GABAergic neurotransmission because antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-Abs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of both SPS and some cases of cerebellar ataxia. In addition, this unusual saccadic velocity profile may have important implications for modeling the saccadic system and furthering a complete understanding of saccade generation.

AB  - We describe the successful anesthetic management of a patient with stiff-person syndrome (SPS) undergoing a right inguinal hernia repair, using a somatic paravertebral block supplemented with conscious sedation. We also present the implications of general anesthesia in patients with SPS. The use of regional anesthetic techniques in patients with SPS has the advantage of avoiding exposure to muscle relaxants. The use of general anesthesia in patients with SPS carries the risk of postoperative hypotonia due to enhancement of gamma-aminobutyric acid action on synaptic transmission by drugs that have a gamma-aminobutyric acid agonistic action.

AB  - The "Stiff person syndrome"(SPS) is a rare dysimmune chronic neurological disorder, sometimes paraneoplastic, characterized by progressive stiffness, painful persistent or spasmodic muscle contractions, mostly involving spine and lower extremities. In 60 to 90 percent of cases, non-paraneoplastic forms are associated to the presence of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD) antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid and in the serum, while anti-amphiphysin antibodies are frequently associated to paraneoplastic types. The relevant treatment consists of three basic approaches: increase in the inhibitory processes in charge of muscle activity control, re-modulation of the immune response, removal of any associated neoplasia. Indications regarding the efficacy of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) also in this dysimmune pathology are on the increase. We described an unusual case of autoimmune SPS associated with an exclusively motor left peroneal nerve neuropathy, with conduction block, treated with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), oral cyclosporine, sodium valproate, baclofen and diazepam.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe novel neurological manifestations associated with glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) autoimmunity., PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study (1987-2003) describes 62 patients Incidentally found to have a serum autoantibody that bound selectively to synapse-rich central nervous system tissues. The immunostaining pattern was determined to be GAD65-specific by radiolmmunoprecipitation assay. These cases were identified among samples submitted for paraneoplastic autoantibody evaluation using indirect immunofluorescence. In no case had GAD65 or any other islet cell antibody testing been requested., RESULTS: In most cases, the patients' presentations were initially considered neurodegenerative or inflammatory (multiple sclerosis or paraneoplastic). Median age at onset was 50 years, and 77% were women. Of the 44 patients seen at the Mayo Clinic, 23% were African American; in contrast, less than 10% of Mayo Clinic's neurology patients are African American. Median follow-up was 24 months. The radioimmunoprecipitation assay values for GAD65 antibody were extremely high (median, 1429 nmol/L; Interquartile range, 643-3078 nmol/L) and correlated significantly with immunofluorescence titers (median, 3840; interquartile range, 1920-15,360; r = 0.81; P < .001). Neurological manifestations were multifocal in 41 patients and included cerebellar ataxia (63%), brainstem involvement (29%), seizures (27%), stiff-man phenomena (26%), extrapyramidal signs (16%), and myelopathy (8%). One third of the patients had type 1 diabetes mellitus, 53% had thyroid autoantibodies, and 16% had vitiligo. Eleven of 20 patients identified as African American had brainstem involvement. Some patients appeared to benefit from short-term immunosuppression (none received long-term therapy)., CONCLUSIONS: The neurological spectrum of GAD65 autoimmunity includes brainstem, extrapyramidal, and spinal cord syndromes. In our experience, African American patients were disproportionately affected. A patient with a presumed neurodegenerative disorder of new onset, with high levels of GAD65 antibody (>20 nmol/L), merits consideration of immunotherapy.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is an autoimmune neurological disorder characterized by autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. To search for biomarkers that distinguish SPS from other neurological disorders (OND), we used surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to obtain proteomic profile of sera from 25 GAD-positive SPS patients and 25 controls. A significant decrease was found in the level of a protein corresponding to GABA(A)-receptor-associated protein (GABARAP), which is responsible for the stability and surface expression of the GABA(A)-receptor. Up to 70% of the SPS sera examined, compared with 10% of the controls, immunoprecipitated GABARAP protein. Antibodies raised against GABARAP immunostained neuronal cell bodies as well as axonal and dendritic processes, as visualized by confocal microscopy. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the IgG from GABARAP antibody-positive patients, but not control IgG, significantly inhibited the surface expression of GABA(A)-receptor. We conclude that GABARAP is a new autoantigen in SPS. Because the patients' IgG inhibits the expression of GABA(A)-receptors, the circulating antibodies could impair GABAergic pathways and play a role in the clinical symptomatology of SPS patients.

AB  - We report five of 38 patients with stiff person syndrome (SPS), who also had cerebellar disease, gait ataxia, dysarthria, and oculomotor dysfunction (SPS-Cer). Cerebellar manifestations either preceded SPS or occurred concurrently. Brain MRI was normal. The intrathecal production of glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies was elevated. Gamma-aminobutyric acid-enhancing drugs and immunotherapies improved only the stiffness. SPS-Cer is a distinct subset of SPS causing a more severe and complex clinical phenotype.

AB  - Paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes associated with Hodgkin's lymphoma include the stiff-person syndrome. A case of stiff-person syndrome is reported who first presented with muscular hyperactivity and acute respiratory failure followed by heterotopic soft tissue ossification and acute seronegative gonarthitis. Initial improvement of a tetanus-like clinical picture was achieved with benzodiazepam given by continuous infusion for analgo-sedation to mechanically ventilate the patient followed by baclofen after successful weaning. The patient was HLA B27 positive and on conventional testing no autoantibodies were detected including anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (anti-GAD). Months later in the absence of signs of stiff-person syndrome, mediastinal lymphadenopathy and pleural effusions developed which were diagnosed as classical Hodgkin's lymphoma that was successfully treated with polychemotherapy. No relapse of paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes was seen after two years of lymphoma remission. The case illustrates that stiff-person syndrome may precede the clinical appearance of symptomatic Hodgkin's lymphoma.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurological disorder characterised by muscular rigidity and superimposed spasms of the trunk and limbs that may be precipitated by voluntary movements and unexpected tactile, auditory or emotional stimulation. The high prevalence of autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (antiGAD) in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid, as well as the frequent association of SPS with other autoimmune disorders, suggest an autoimmune pathogenesis. SPS is frequently misdiagnosed as axial dystonia or psychogenic movement disorder. We report a patient with SPS in order to emphasise the reasons for this common misdiagnosis.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is an unusual cause of muscle rigidity and spasms. It is believed to have an autoimmune pathogenesis and is associated with autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). Paraneoplastic SPS (PSPS) has been described mainly in relation to breast cancer and is associated with antibodies to amphiphysin. Few reports of PSPS document the finding of GAD autoantibodies. We present the first reported case of anti-GAD positive PSPS in a 53-year-old male with occult renal carcinoma. Clinical benefit was marked following nephrectomy and intravenous immunoglobulin treatment. Renal carcinoma should be considered in patients with SPS. Copyright 2007 Movement Disorder Society

AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is an uncommon disorder characterized by progressive muscle stiffness, rigidity, and axial muscle spasms. It is presumed to be an autoimmune process, with glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies present in most cases. Here, we present a case report of a patient diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) acquired by sexual trauma and by exposure to the severely wounded soldiers she attended as a nurse. Subsequently, she developed SPS confirmed by serology. The possibility of an association between PTSD and SPS is theorized, given their relationship to the GABAergic system. Further studies examining the relation between PTSD and SPS should be initiated.

AB  - We measured expression of central nervous system GABA-A receptors with (11)C-flumazenil ((11)C-FMZ) and PET in two subjects with stiff person syndrome (SPS). We found reduced (11)C-FMZ binding potential (BP) in motor-premotor cortex, and increased (11)C-FMZ BP in the cerebellar nuclei. This is the first in vivo PET evidence of central GABA-A receptors dysfunction in SPS, possibly concurring to the motor symptoms. Copyright (c) 2007 Movement Disorder Society.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS) has been associated with autoimmune diseases, such as Type 1 diabetes mellitus and autoimmune thyroid disease (Hashimoto's thyroiditis), among others. The association of SPS with hyperthyroidism is extremely rare. We describe a patient with uncontrolled Graves' disease and undiagnosed SPS, who presented initially with acute ataxia simulating a cerebrovascular accident. Initiation of immunosuppressive therapy dramatically improved the patient's Graves' disease within 2 weeks but the neurological symptoms were not alleviated after a follow-up period of 3 years.

AB  - We report the successful management of anesthesia in a patient with stiff-person syndrome (SPS) undergoing a thymectomy using a volatile anesthetic combined with epidural anesthesia. The anesthetic concern in patients with SPS is the possibility of postoperative hypotonia due to the presence of excessive gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) resulting from an interaction between the anesthetic agents and preoperatively taken therapeutic drugs. Epidural anesthesia has the advantages of decreasing the required amount of anesthetics with GABAergic action, and relieving the postoperative pain that causes the symptoms of SPS. Epidural anesthesia could be a useful technique in SPS patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We report a case of a 58-year-old man suffering from stiff-person syndrome and recurrent peripheral vertigo., METHOD: A case report and a review of the recent literature on stiff-person syndrome are presented., RESULTS: The patient presented with recurrent episodes of vertigo with a pure peripheral pattern and with concomitant episodes of burning muscle pain, muscle twitching, weight gain and fatigue, worsening with tension or stress that also occurred in periods without vertigo. Cochlear examinations only showed presbyacusis-like hearing loss. The diagnosis of stiff-person syndrome was made with electromyographic examination and from findings in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of high titres of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67) autoantibodies. In a two-year follow-up period, therapy for stiff-person syndrome abolished episodes of both stiffness and vertigo., CONCLUSION: As far as we know, no other clinical case of acute vestibular damage with a possible correlation with anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies has been described. Peripheral vertigo possibly related to a lack of gamma aminobutyric acid underlines a possible role of gamma aminobutyric acid as a neurotransmitter in the peripheral vestibular system.

AB  - Highly reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis of neurological diseases are not widely available. Here we evaluated a luciferase immunoprecipitation technology (LIPS) for the diagnosis of a CNS autoimmune disorder, stiff-person syndrome (SPS). Analysis by LIPS of 40 sera samples from SPS and control subjects for anti-GAD65 antibodies revealed dramatic titer differences allowing diagnosis of SPS with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Anti-GAD65 antibody titers of SPS were segregated from controls with values greater than 23 standard deviations above the control subject mean. By analyzing patient antibody responses directly to GAD65 sub-fragments, the central region containing the decarboxylase catalytic domain was highly immunoreactive with all of the SPS sera, while the N- and C-terminal regions showed lower antibody titers and only reacted with subsets of SPS sera. Additional profiling revealed that some SPS patients showed autoantibodies against GAD67 and tyrosine hydroxylase, but no significant immunoreactivity was detected with cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase or GABA transaminase. This study validates LIPS as a robust method to interrogate autoantibodies for the diagnosis of SPS and potentially other neurological diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Uncommonly, adult-onset dystonia is confined to one lower extremity. We sought to characterize the clinical spectrum associated with the presenting phenotype of lower limb dystonia including foot torsion., METHODS: Retrospective computer search of the Mayo Clinic Medical Records Linkage System (1996-2006). Inclusion criteria were (1) a principal, initial diagnosis of monomelic lower extremity dystonia with foot torsion; (2) no neurologic findings outside of the affected limb; (3) age-onset>18 years. Prospective data were sought from apparent idiopathic cases., RESULTS: We identified 36 patients (31 females) presenting with monomelic lower limb dystonia including foot torsion. Onset was usually subacute or insidious (32 patients); mean symptom duration was 28.8 months (range, 1-96), age-onset 47.5 years (range, 21-77). After a mean follow-up of 3.1 years, causes were identified in over half, including 5 with parkinsonism. Other treatable etiologies included psychogenic dystonia (3 patients) and stiff-limb syndrome (2 patients). Post-traumatic dystonia was diagnosed in 10 patients and consistently manifested as fixed, painful foot torsion, in contrast to the action-induced dystonia in 5 parkinsonism cases, and 10 of 14 patients with primary lower limb dystonia. Imaging identified the cause in only 1 patient (ischemic stroke) and was negative in the single patient with pyramidal signs., CONCLUSIONS: Adults presenting with monomelic lower limb dystonia with foot torsion often have an identifiable cause, sometimes treatable, including Parkinson's disease (diagnosed with levodopa trial) or immune-mediated stiff-limb syndrome. Post-traumatic dystonia was the single most frequent cause and proved difficult to treat. Unlike certain other series of such patients, psychogenic dystonia was an uncommon clinical diagnosis.

AB  - Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune disorder associated with antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-Ab), the key enzyme in gamma-aminobutyric acid synthesis (GABA). In order to investigate the role of cerebral benzodiazepinereceptor binding in SPS, we performed [(11)C]flumazenil (FMZ) positron emission tomography (PET) in a female patient with SPS compared to nine healthy controls. FMZ is a radioligand to the postsynaptic central benzodiazepine receptor which is co-localized with the GABA-A receptor. In the SPS patient, we found a global reduction of cortical FMZ binding. In addition, distinct local clusters of reduced radiotracer binding were observed. These data provide first in vivo evidence for a reduced postsynaptic GABA-A receptor availability which may reflect the loss of GABAergic neuronal inhibition in SPS.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Persistent intrathecal production of IgG autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65 IgG) and oligoclonal IgG of undetermined specificity has been reported in stiff person syndrome (SPS)., METHODS: To chart the avidity and clonal patterns of GAD65 IgG, we performed scatchard plot of binding characteristics and isoelectric focusing-immunoblot of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum from five SPS patients., RESULTS: Oligoclonal GAD65 IgG bands, predominantly restricted to the IgG1 subclass, were detected in CSF and serum in all patients. The distribution of GAD65-specific IgG bands in serum and CSF revealed intrathecal synthesis of oligoclonal GAD65 IgG in all five patients, whilst radioimmunoassay demonstrated intrathecal synthesis of GAD65 IgG in four. The binding avidity of GAD65 IgG from CSF was more than 10 times higher than in serum in two of the patients but did not differ substantially in the remaining three. These differences were not related to symptom severity. The pattern of oligoclonal GAD65 IgG bands in CSF and serum in three patients examined remained unchanged for up to 7 years after symptom debut., CONCLUSION: This study confirms the persistent systemic and intrathecal production of GAD65-specific IgG in SPS, and further shows that this immune response is oligoclonal and mediated by a stable population of affinity maturated B cell clones.

AB  - The association of high levels of autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-ab) and stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is well known. However, the full spectrum of neurological syndromes associated with GAD-ab is not well established. In addition, these patients usually present type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) that could justify the presence of high GAD-ab levels. To clarify these issues, we reviewed the clinical and immunological features of patients in whom high GAD-ab levels were detected in a reference centre for DM1 and for the detection of antineuronal antibodies in suspected paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS). High GAD-ab levels were defined as values > or =2000 U/ml by radioimmunoassay. Intrathecal synthesis (IS) of GAD-ab was calculated in paired serum/CSF samples. Values higher than the IgG index were considered indicators for positive GAD-ab-specific IS. High GAD-ab levels were identified in 61 patients, 22 (36%) had SPS, 17 (28%) cerebellar ataxia, 11 (18%) other neurological disorders (epilepsy -- four, PNS -- four; idiopathic limbic encephalitis -- two; myasthenia gravis -- one), and 11 (18%) isolated DM1. Patients with SPS and cerebellar ataxia had the same frequency of female gender (86% vs 94%), DM1 (59% vs 53%), CSF oligoclonal bands (35% vs 69%). Three of the four PNS patients, with paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis, a predominant gait cerebellar ataxia, and limbic encephalitis, had neuroendocrine carcinomas. GAD expression was confirmed in the two tumours in which the study was done. The fourth patient presented with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration antedating a lung adenocarcinoma. The frequency of increased IS of GAD-ab was 85% in SPS, 100% in cerebellar ataxia, and 86% in other neurological disorders. In conclusion, our study emphasizes that high GAD-ab levels associate with other neurological disorders besides SPS. Cerebellar ataxia, the second most common syndrome associated with high GAD-ab levels, shares with SPS the same demographic, clinical and immunological features. The demonstration of an increased IS of GAD-ab is important to confirm that the GAD autoimmunity is related to the neurological syndrome particularly when there is a concomitant DM1 that could justify the presence of high GAD-ab levels. Lastly, in patients who develop neurological syndromes that suggest a PNS, the finding of GAD-ab does not rule out this possibility and appropriate studies should be done to confirm an underlying cancer.

AB  - We studied the effects of oral levetiracetam (LEV) (500 mg twice daily) in three women with stiff-person syndrome in a single-blind, placebo-controlled study. The severity of muscle rigidity and of paroxysmal symptoms was assessed by EMG and clinically by a rating scale of 0-4 and by the Patients Global Impressions Scale. LEV was well tolerated. On active treatment all patients improved as assessed by any of the objective or subjective outcome measures. No response was noticed on placebo. Our data indicate that in patients with SPS, LEV is well tolerated and has a therapeutic role in the management of both muscle stiffness and life-threatening paroxysmal respiratory spasms.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is an immunologically mediated central nervous system disorder that is infrequently associated with malignancy. We report a 31-year-old woman who developed SPS after autologous bone marrow transplantation and subsequent interferon treatment for multiple myeloma. Anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD) antibody serology was positive. The myeloma remains in remission 10 years posttransplant. SPS has been described in association with lung cancer and breast cancer, thymoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma. This is the second report of SPS in a patient with myeloma and the first description of SPS following autologous transplantation. Aberrant immune reconstitution is known to occur following hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation. Interferon is also known to augment the immune response posttransplant. We speculate that an aberrant posttransplant immune response may have caused both the SPS and an autologous graft-versus-myeloma effect, resulting in prolonged remission posttransplant.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stiff-person syndrome (SPS), formerly Stiff-man syndrome, is a rare autoimmune disease usually exhibiting severe spasms and thoracolumbar stiffness, with very elevated glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GAD Ab). A paraneoplastic variant, less well characterized, is associated with amphiphysin antibodies (amphiphysin Ab). The objective of this study was to identify distinctive clinical features of amphiphysin Ab-associated SPS., METHODS: Records associated with 845 sera tested in the Yale SPS project were examined, and 621 patients with clinically suspected SPS were included in the study. Clinical characteristics were assessed with correction for multiple comparisons., RESULTS: In all, 116 patients had GAD antibodies and 11 patients had amphiphysin Ab; some clinical information was available for 112 and 11 of these patients, respectively. Patients with amphiphysin Ab-associated SPS were exclusively female; mean age was 60. All except one had breast cancer; none had diabetes. Compared to patients with GAD Ab-associated SPS, those with amphiphysin Ab were older (p = 0.02) and showed a dramatically different stiffness pattern (p < 0.0000001) with cervical involvement more likely, p < or = 0.001. Electromyography showed continuous motor unit activity or was reported positive in eight. Benzodiazepines at high dose (average 50 mg/day diazepam) were partially effective. Four patients were steroid responsive and tumor excision with chemotherapy produced marked clinical improvement in three of five patients., CONCLUSIONS: Amphiphysin Ab-associated stiff-person syndrome is strongly associated with cervical region stiffness, female sex, breast cancer, advanced age, EMG abnormalities, and benzodiazepine responsiveness. The condition may respond to steroids and can dramatically improve with cancer treatment.

AB  - We reported a 27-year-old man presenting with progressive muscle rigidity and intermittent spasms for six years. The diagnosis of stiff-person syndrome was based on the clinical features and neuroelectrophysiologic findings of continuous motor unit activities. Autoantibody against glutamic acid decarboxylase in our patient was absent either in serum or in cerebrospinal fluid. The patient was successfully treated with intrathecal baclofen therapy after a series of unsatisfactory traditional medical treatments. From our experience, we propose that intrathecal baclofen could be a considerable alternative treatment for patients with refractory stiff-person syndrome.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present the case of a patient with anxiety and depressive symptoms who developed the clinical picture of stiff-person plus syndrome (SPS-plus)., BACKGROUND: Before the onset of typical SPS symptoms, psychiatric symptoms (like depression and anxiety) may be prominent and as such misleading, resulting in the diagnosis of a psychiatric condition., METHOD: We describe the case of a woman who initially presented with anxious depression and remained resistant to treatment with different classes of antidepressants and additional therapy with lithium and atypical antipsychotics., RESULTS: Evidence of neurologic dysfunction and significantly increased levels of serum autoantibodies for glutamic acid decarboxylase supported the diagnosis of SPS. The patient appeared to benefit from short-term immunosuppressive therapy with methylprednisolone., CONCLUSIONS: The authors believe that anxious depression and SPS-plus seen in this patient are the result of the same underlying autoimmune process, together forming a unique syndrome. Anxious and depressive symptoms in SPS can be explained by alterations in GABAergic neurotransmission.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurological disorder characterised by progressive stiffness and painful muscle spasms. We present a case of the autoimmune form of glutamate decarboxylase-positive SPS that initially manifested in pregnancy. The diagnosis was made based on clinical, laboratory and electromyoneurographic criteria. The patient was administered low doses of diazepam and baclofen. Considering the clinical picture of SPS patients, caesarean section is the method of choice for pregnancy termination.

AB  - Antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are involved in the pathophysiology of stiff-person syndrome (SPS) and type 1 diabetes. GAD catalyses the conversion of glutamate to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). GABA acts as a neurotransmitter between neurones, while in pancreatic beta cells it plays an integral role in normal insulin secretion, hence the clinical presentation of muscular spasms in SPS and insulin deficiency in diabetes. Despite this apparent major overlap in pathophysiology, SPS only rarely occurs in individuals with type 1 diabetes. We report the case of a 41-year-old man presenting with a simultaneous diagnosis of both these conditions. His case is unusual in that it is the first reported case in the literature of these conditions occurring in someone with celiac disease (CD) and dermatitis herpetiformis. We discuss why SPS and type 1 diabetes co-exist in only a minority of cases and speculate on the underlying mechanism of the association with CD and dermatitis herpetiformis in our patient.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stiff-person syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by rigidity of axial or limb muscles with episodes of co-contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles during the spasms. In some patients axial or limb involvement may predominate and may have unusual manifestations., DESIGN: Case report., SETTING: Tertiary care teaching hospital., PATIENT: A 42-year-old farmer presented with seasonal occurrence of hiccup and vomiting during summer months for the last 3 years. He had painful lower limb spasms lasting for 2-3 minutes every 10-15 minutes for the past 20 days. His neurological examination was normal, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 50 mm at 1st hour, and cerebrospinal fluid protein 78 mg/dL without pleocytosis. Radiograph of chest, abdominal ultrasound, and craniospinal magnetic resonance imaging were normal. The patient improved on diazepam., CONCLUSION: Our patient is a forme fruste of stiff person syndrome with hiccups and vomiting due to diaphragmatic spasm.

TI  - Stiff person syndrome: presentation of a case with repetitive complex discharges in electromiograms.
AU  - Jimenez Caballero, Pedro Enrique
PY  - 2009
PD  - /
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Stiff person syndrome is characterized by rigidity of axial and proximal limb muscles, associated with muscle spasms, triggered by unexpected acoustic or somesthetic stimuli. It usually has an autoimmune basis, in which the blood contains antiglutamate decarboxylase antibodies, and is associated with different types of autoimmune diseases. The electromyogram provides evidences of continuous muscular activity., CASE REPORT: A 41-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type I, Hashimoto thyroiditis, vitiligo, and pernicious anemia developed symptoms compatible with stiff person syndrome. In the electromyogram, in addition to continuous muscular activity, there was evidence of complex repetitive activity in the form of doublets and triplets., CONCLUSIONS: Given the absence of clinical or electrophysiological neuropathic affectation, the presence of doublets and triplets in our patient could be due to a subclinical functional alteration of alpha motoneurons. They could produce the complex repetitive discharges when released from the inhibition mediated by GABAergic neurons.

AB  - We present a 67-year-old non-diabetic male who presented with muscle cramps, paresis, atrophy and fasciculations in the left leg, followed by rapidly progressive muscle stiffness and superimposed spasms which subsequently also affected the right leg and the trunk. GAD65 autoantibodies were elevated in serum and CSF, compatible with systemic and intrathecal synthesis of oligoclonal and high-avidity autoantibodies, and GAD65 specific T cells were clonally expanded in the CSF. The patient did not respond to GABAergic and immunomodulatory treatment or plasma exchange, and died from respiratory failure after 18 months. Autopsy revealed unilateral axonal swelling, chromatolysis and vacuolisation of anterior horn cells of the lower spinal cord, accompanied by microglia proliferation and discrete infiltration of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. No CD4+ T helper cells, B cells or complement deposition were detected. To our knowledge, this is the first report of stiff person syndrome with lower motor signs restricted to a lower limb, and also the first attempt to characterize the infiltrating T cells. The finding of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells in the absence of B cells in the inflamed area of the spinal cord suggests that the intrathecal synthesis of GAD65 autoantibodies takes place in areas of the CNS not strictly related to the clinically relevant lesions.

AB  - Stiff limb syndrome (SLS) is a rare chronic condition which can result in significant debility. We report the case of a 44-year-old man suffering from severe painful spasms in his right leg with a diagnosis of SLS. He had been initially treated for his pain with a spinal cord stimulator but presented with exacerbation of pain secondary to a lead fracture for which he underwent revision of the stimulator. Postoperative programming unexpectedly resulted in not only control of his pain but also an ability to abort his spasmodic episodes related to SLS. To our knowledge, spinal cord stimulation has not been previously used for SLS and our report opens up another avenue for this rare condition. We provide a brief overview of SLS and propose an underlying mechanism for the observed phenomenon.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) and an important autoantigen both in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and stiff-person syndrome (SPS). Autoantibodies (GADA) to the 65-kDa isoform of GAD are a characteristic feature in both diseases. Approximately 30% of patients with SPS develop diabetes, yet, it is unclear to which extent co-existing autoimmunity to GAD65 and other islet autoantigens determines the risk of developing T1D., METHODS: In this study, we monitored CD4+ T-cell responses to GAD65 and proinsulin in a patient with SPS who remained normoglycaemic during the 46-month follow-up., RESULTS: Fluctuating but persistent T-cell reactivity to GAD65 was identified, as well as T-cell reactivity to proinsulin at one time point. The majority of the T-cell clones isolated from the patient with SPS produced high levels of Th2 cytokines (IL-13, IL-5 and IL-4). We also examined levels of GADA, insulin and IA-2 autoantibodies, and epitope specificity of GADA. In both serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), GADA levels were high, and GADA persisted throughout the follow-up. Despite T-cell reactivity to both GAD65 and proinsulin, autoantibodies to other islet autoantigens did not develop., CONCLUSIONS: Further follow-up will determine whether the beta-cell autoimmunity observed in this patient will eventually lead to T1D.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare disorder that affects the central nervous system, being characterized by intermittent episodes of muscle spasms, rigidity, and a significant increase in morbidity and mortality. We report a 29-year-old patient, with left-sided chylothorax and thymoma, who presented with truncal, lower extremities stiffness and painful cramps alleviated by diazepam and opiates. His clinical picture was suggestive of SPS secondary to invasive thymoma. This syndrome is best approached by its early recognition and prompt treatment since a missed diagnosis can have deleterious outcome. An intensive search for the underlying etiology is of utmost importance in the management of SPS. A review of the current literature is also included in this manuscript.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome is a rare neurologic disorder characterized by fluctuating and progressive stiffness of axial and limb musculature. The high prevalence of autoantibodies and associated autoimmune diseases in patients with stiff person syndrome suggests that it may have an autoimmune etiology. We report a case of a 62-year-old man with diabetes who developed progressive stiffness of the hips and legs and elevated levels of antibody to glutamic acid decarboxylase. He had a partial response to both baclofen and diazepam, but could not tolerate the treatment because of somnolence. He eventually received 2 infusions of rituximab 1000 mg a week apart. The baclofen was discontinued and the diazepam was tapered. However, 6 months after the rituximab treatment, despite continued clinical improvement the patient had persistently elevated titers of antibody to glutamic acid decarboxylase. We postulate that rituximab was associated with clinical improvement through mechanisms other than antibody depletion.

AB  - Stiff limb syndrome (SLS) is a rare "focal" variant of stiff person syndrome which presents with rigidity and painful spasms of a distal limb, and abnormal fixed foot or hand postures. Anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GAD-Ab) are variably present in most cases. Most reported cases of SLS are unassociated with cancer. We describe a patient with SLS as a paraneoplastic manifestation of breast carcinoma, in whom GAD-Ab was present. The patient responded very well to oral diazepam, baclofen and steroids. This is the third reported case of SLS as a paraneoplastic accompaniment to cancer.

AB  - We investigated the prevalence and the clinical association of high titer of antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (hGADAb) among unselected patients with inflammatory/autoimmune disorders of the nervous system. By indirect immunofluorescence examination of samples from 1435 patients, we identified 7 cases (0.48%) with hGADAb. Although stiff-person plus syndrome was the commonest clinical accompaniment, most of the patients presented with a combination of different symptoms, including psychiatric disturbances and intestinal motility disorders. Diagnosis delay and chronic evolution were common findings. In two cases persistently high values of hGADAb over the years were observed. The rarity and the phenotype heterogeneity of hGADAb clinical association should not discourage clinicians from antibody screening, at least in selected cases, as an early immunotherapy can change the otherwise chronic progression of this complex disorder spectrum.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a CNS disorder of putative autoimmune aetiology, which is clinically characterized by severe rigidity and spasms. In most cases, SPS is associated with serum antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-Ab). Recent studies suggested that GAD-Ab might be directly involved in the pathogenesis of SPS. Further support for this hypothesis would come from studies providing qualitative evidence for the presence of GAD-Ab-producing B cell clones within the CNS of patients with SPS., OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: To address that issue, we (i) analysed paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples from ten GAD-Ab positive patients with SPS and controls by an antigen-driven affinity blotting technique for the presence of GAD-specific oligoclonal IgG bands (OCBs) in the CSF, and (ii) examined the immunoreactive pattern of CSF and serum IgG to recombinant GAD by immunoblotting. To confirm our results quantitatively, we (iii) assessed anti-GAD antibody reactivity in CSF and serum using ELISA and evaluated the GAD-specific antibody index., RESULTS: GAD-specific oligoclonal bands exclusively or predominately in CSF compared to the corresponding serum were detected in 10/10 patients with GAD-positive SPS but in none of the controls. Immunoblotting revealed stronger staining in the CSF, suggestive of intrathecal IgG synthesis, in 7/10 patients upon visual inspection, and in 8/10 patients upon densitometric analysis. A positive GAD-specific antibody index was found in 9/10 patients., CONCLUSIONS: Here we demonstrate for the first time that IgG OCBs in SPS bind GAD. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussion on whether the autoimmune process against GAD is involved in the pathogenesis of SPS by indicating that anti-GAD-Ab is produced by B cell clones within the CNS.

AB  - We report a case of stiff-person syndrome associated with several autoimmune diseases. A 49-year-old male with type 1 diabetes presented with a 6-month history of muscle rigidity and spasms of his upper and lower extremities. Anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 antibody was elevated at 609 nmol/L. Electromyography revealed continuous motor unit activity in agonist and antagonist muscles. He responded favorably to diazepam, baclofen, and intravenous immunoglobulin infusions. This case report describes stiff-person syndrome in association with pernicious anemia and diabetes mellitus. A review of the literature discusses the diagnosis and treatment of this rare entity.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurological condition consisting of progressive and fluctuating rigidity of the axial muscles combined with painful spasms. The pathophysiology of SPS is not fully understood, but there seems to be an autoimmune component. The use of rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeting CD20 protein in the surface of mature B cells, for the treatment of SPS is a recent therapeutical approach showing promising results. The authors present a case report of a 41-year-old female patient diagnosed with SPS who was treated with rituximab in a public hospital in Brasilia, Brazil, showing a good and safe response to the treatment so far. Our data go along with some recent articles published in the literature.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report a case of a 35-year-old female initially treated for anorexia nervosa who was found to have Stiff-Person Syndrome (SPS)., METHOD: Case report., RESULTS: The patient reported panic attacks at meal times that were found to consist of tetanic contractions of the axial musculature. Swallowing initiated reflexive painful muscle spasms that consequently resulted in cibophobia and significant weight loss. Her serum tested positive for anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, and she subsequently improved with appropriate treatment for SPS., DISCUSSION: SPS has not been previously reported in the context of eating disorders, although it has been linked to other psychiatric disorders. Often the psychiatrist may be the first physician to diagnose SPS. We present this case to alert practitioners to the potential co-morbidity and symptom overlap between SPS and eating disorders, to aid in early recognition and appropriate treatment of this rare illness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The high prevalence of gluten sensitivity in patients with stiff-person syndrome (SPS) lead us to investigate the relationship between gluten sensitivity and GAD-antibody-associated diseases., METHODS: We used ELISA assays for anti-GAD and for serological markers of gluten sensitivity. Patients were recruited from clinics based at the Royal Hallamshire hospital, Sheffield, UK. Patients with gluten sensitivity were followed up after the introduction of a gluten-free diet and serological testing was repeated., RESULTS: Six of seven (86%) patients with SPS were positive for anti-GAD, mean titre 109 U/ml; This compared with 9/90 (11%) patients with idiopathic sporadic ataxia, mean titre 32 U/ml, 16/40 (40%) patients with gluten ataxia, mean titre 25 U/ml, and 6/10 patients with type 1 diabetes only, mean titre 8 U/ml. None of 32 patients with celiac disease only, and of 40 patients with genetic ataxia were positive for anti-GAD. The titre of anti-GAD reduced following the introduction of a gluten-free diet in patients with SPS who had serological evidence of gluten sensitivity. The same was observed in patients with gluten ataxia and anti-GAD antibodies. This was also associated with clinical improvement., CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a link between gluten sensitivity and GAD antibody-associated diseases. Copyright © 2010 The Authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Glycine receptor antibodies (GlyR-ab) were reported in a patient with progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM)., METHODS: Three additional patients were clinically described. GlyR-ab was detected with a cell-based assay of HEK293 cells transfected with the alpha1 subunit of the GyR., RESULTS: A 33-year-old woman presented with diplopia, dysphagia and gait ataxia that improved in 5 weeks. Then, she developed a typical stiff-person syndrome (SPS) that resolved with corticosteroids, but relapsed 17 months later with a stiff limb syndrome. After treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), she has been asymptomatic for 8 years. A 60-year-old man developed, dysphagia, diplopia, left facial palsy and right trigeminal hypoaesthesia in a few days, followed by muscular rigidity, corticospinal signs, myoclonic jerks and severe dysautonomia. He developed seizures and suffered a cardiac arrest that left him in a persistent vegetative state. A 48-year-old man presented with leg rigidity and frequent spells of trismus, muscle spasms followed by opisthotonus and diaphoresis. The symptoms were antedated by pruritus of the left scapulae, right arm and T11-T12 dermatome. At the same time he became progressively more aggressive with emotional irritability. He also developed dysgeusia (metallic taste) and severe concurrent behavioural changes and diurnal hypersomnia. Only the rigidity and the spasms improved after therapy., CONCLUSIONS: The clinical picture associated with GlyR-ab is wider than the classical view of PERM. GlyR-ab should be examined in patients with core symptoms of muscle rigidity and spasms atypical for SPS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate whether Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) and cerebellar ataxia (CA) are associated with distinct GAD65-Ab epitope specificities and neuronal effects., METHODS: Purified GAD65-Ab from neurological patients and monoclonal GAD65-Ab with distinct epitope specificities (b78 and b96.11) were administered in vivo to rat cerebellum. Effects of intra-cerebellar administration of GAD65-Ab were determined using neurophysiological and neurochemical methods., RESULTS: Intra-cerebellar administration of GAD65-Ab from a SPS patient (Ab SPS) impaired the NMDA-mediated turnover of glutamate, but had no effect on NMDA-mediated turnover of glycerol. By contrast, GAD65-Ab from a patient with cerebellar ataxia (Ab CA) markedly decreased the NMDA-mediated turnover of glycerol. Both GAD65-Ab increased the excitability of the spinal cord, as assessed by the F wave/M wave ratios. The administration of BFA, an inhibitor of the recycling of vesicles, followed by high-frequency stimulation of the cerebellum, severely impaired the cerebello-cortical inhibition only when Ab CA was used. Moreover, administration of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the motor cortex revealed a strong disinhibition of the motor cortex with Ab CA. Monoclonal antibodies b78 and b96.11 showed distinct effects, with greater effects of b78 in terms of increase of glutamate concentrations, impairment of the adaptation of the motor cortex to repetitive peripheral stimulation, disinhibition of the motor cortex following tDCS, and increase of the F/M ratios. Ab SPS shared antibody characteristics with b78, both in epitope recognition and ability to inhibit enzyme activity, while Ab CA had no effect on GAD65 enzyme activity., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that, in vivo, neurological impairments caused by GAD65-Ab could vary according to epitope specificities. These results could explain the different neurological syndromes observed in patients with GAD65-Ab.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare condition of progressive muscular rigidity and spasm, frequently accompanied by other autoimmune conditions, an association which has been further strengthened by the discovery of anti-GAD antibodies and the response of SPS to immunotherapies. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is the mainstay therapy. Because of the rarity of the GAD antibody associated conditions, most of the information regarding treatment is case series and individual case reports. Here we describe the 15 year long management of a subject with SPS who has had a favourable outcome.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stiff person syndrome is a rare neurological disorder characterized by stiffness and painful spasms primarily in the trunk and lower extremities. The role of physical therapy in the management of this disorder is disputed and the efficacy of specific interventions is unknown., CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was a 24-year-old woman with a 1-year history of stiff person syndrome who received outpatient physical therapy over the course of 15 weeks. She had pain, muscle spasms, gait anomalies, and range-of-motion deficits, which affected her left lower extremity. Physical therapy interventions consisted of ultrasound, soft tissue mobilizations, manual stretching, and exercise. She also was fitted for a custom-made ankle-foot orthosis. Outcome This patient showed decreased pain and muscle spasms, as well as improvements in gait and range of motion., DISCUSSION: Stiffness and spasms interfere with the ability of these patients to fully mobilize affected joints, and they are at risk of developing further complications. Physical therapy may have a role in the management of this disease, as these patients need to be taught how to properly stretch and maintain joint mobility as a lifelong commitment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stiff person syndrome, also known as Moersche-Woltman syndrome, is a debilitating disorder that is rarely seen in the pregnant patient. It is characterized by muscle spasms triggered by startle, voluntary movement, or tactile or emotional stimuli, occurring predominantly in the axial musculature., CASE: A woman diagnosed with stiff person syndrome became pregnant 2 months after her diagnosis. Her medication regimen was adjusted because of pregnancy, and anesthesia was initiated early in labor to control her pain. She was able to have a full-term pregnancy with few complications., CONCLUSION: Stiff person syndrome may be successfully managed in pregnancy. Patients can deliver vaginally with adequate pain control to avoid muscle spasms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The syndrome of progressive encephalopathy with limb rigidity has been historically termed progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) or stiff-person syndrome plus., METHODS: The case is presented of a previously healthy 28-year-old man with a rapidly fatal form of PERM developing over 2 months., RESULTS: Serum antibodies to both NMDA receptors (NMDAR) and glycine receptors (GlyR) were detected postmortem, and examination of the brain confirmed an autoimmune encephalomyelitis, with particular involvement of hippocampal pyramidal and cerebellar Purkinje cells and relative sparing of the neocortex. No evidence for an underlying systemic neoplasm was found., CONCLUSION: This case displayed not only the clinical features of PERM, previously associated with GlyR antibodies, but also some of the features associated with NMDAR antibodies. This unusual combination of antibodies may be responsible for the particularly progressive course and sudden death.

AB  - We report a 29-year-old man who presented with a 2-year history of progressive stiffness and painful spasms limited to the bilateral lower limbs, exaggerated by auditory and tactile stimuli. His deep tendon reflexes were slightly increased in both lower extremities. His plantar response was flexor. His serum and cerebrospinal fluid were negative for anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies. Electromyography of antagonist muscle pairs in his distal lower limbs revealed a failure of reciprocal inhibition. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation with a paired-pulse paradigm, delivered to the cortical area of the upper and lower limbs, and revealed significantly enhanced facilitation only in the area of his lower limbs, but not that representing his upper limbs. His symptoms were improved substantially by 20mg/day of oral diazepam. To our knowledge this is the first report of a patient with hyperexcitability limited to the lower limb motor system in a patient with stiff-leg syndrome. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare disorder characterized by muscle stiffness and painful spasms. Misdiagnosis may occur due to the fact that the clinical picture of SPS is often atypical. The main pathophysiologic mechanism underlying the development of SPS is insufficient inhibition at the cortical and spinal levels. There is good evidence for a primary autoimmune etiology. A 61-year-old man was admitted to a neurological department due to muscle hypertonia with episodic attacks of painful spasms predominantly affecting axial muscles. The symptoms developed shortly after tickborne meningoencephalitis. Electromyography (EMG) revealed signs of continuous motor unit activity. Antibodies against glutamate decarboxylase (anti-GAD) were highly elevated. We present a case of a man who developed clinically severe anti-GAD positive SPS, provoked by tick-borne encephalitis. After therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) a rapid, temporary improvement of the clinical and neurophysiological findings was noted. Only after being placed on long-term immunosuppression did the patient achieve stable recovery. This case supports the importance of EMG findings and demonstrates the effect of TPE as well as the need for chronic immunosuppression in severe cases of SPS.

AB  - Symptomatic treatment of stiff-person syndrome (SPS) might be challenging and a significant improvement of stiffness and rigidity is generally reached with high doses of benzodiazepines or baclofen causing side effects. A 71-year old woman diagnosed with SPS complained of marked stiffness of trunk and lower limb muscles with sudden painful spasms. She was unable to walk and she could not lean on her right leg. Cortical silent period (CSP) duration evaluated from right abductor pollicis brevis (APB) with transcranial magnetic stimulation was shortened. Polygraphic electromyographic (EMG) evaluation from paraspinal and leg muscles disclosed continuous motor unit activity at rest with interference muscular pattern. Symptomatic treatment with diazepam was withdrawn because of excessive sedation. In order to relieve the intense lumbar pain, she was prescribed pregabalin; since the day after, rigidity and painful spasms dramatically improved and she could walk without assistance. The clinical benefit persisted at 3 months follow-up and was paralleled by almost complete disappearance of EMG activity at rest and prolongation of CSP. The clinical and electrophysiological data in this SPS patient suggest the possible efficacy of pregabalin as symptomatic treatment without any significant side effects, which needs to be replicated in larger case series.

AB  - Glycine receptor (GlyR) antibodies were recently identified in a few patients with progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM); none of these patients had antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). An inhibitory glycinergic transmission defect has also been implicated in the mechanism underlying saccadic oscillations, including ocular flutter or opsoclonus; GlyR antibodies have not been reported in these patients. The purpose was to determine whether GlyR antibodies are found in patients with PERM, ocular flutter syndrome (OFS), and opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (OMS). GlyR antibodies were first measured in archived sera and CSF from five patients, including one patient with GAD antibody-positive PERM, two patients with OFS, and two patients with OMS. GlyR antibodies were also measured in archived sera from nine other adult patients with OMS. GlyR antibodies and GAD antibodies were both found at high titers in the serum and CSF of the patient with PERM, and their levels paralleled disease activity over time. GlyR antibodies were not found at significant levels in 13 patients with saccadic oscillations. GlyR and GAD antibodies can co-exist in PERM and follow the clinical course. Although saccadic oscillations are a feature of this condition, GlyR antibodies are not commonly found in patients with isolated saccadic oscillations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little information is available about the incidence of stiff-man syndrome (SMS) (the classic form or its variants) or about long-term treatment responses and outcomes., OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively describe the characteristics of a cohort of patients with SMS., DESIGN: Observational study., SETTING: Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota., PATIENTS: Ninety-nine patients with classic SMS vs variants of the disorder, both glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 kD isoform (GAD65) antibody seropositive and seronegative., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neurological, autoimmune, serological, and oncological findings; treatments; and outcomes between January 1984 and December 2008., RESULTS: The median follow-up duration was 5 years (range, 0-23 years). Seventy-nine patients (59 having classic SMS, 19 having partial SMS, and 1 having progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus [PERM]) were GAD65 antibody seropositive. Sixty-seven percent (53 of 79) of them had at least 1 coexisting autoimmune disease, and 4% (3 of 79) had cancer. GAD65 antibody values at initial evaluation were significantly higher among patients with classic SMS (median value, 623 nmol/L) than among patients with partial SMS (median value, 163 nmol/L) (P < .001). The initial GAD65 antibody value was positively correlated with the last follow-up Rankin score (P = .03). Among 20 patients who were GAD65 antibody seronegative (6 with classic SMS, 12 with partial SMS, and 2 with PERM), 15% (3 of 20) had at least 1 coexisting autoimmune disease, and 25% (5 of 20) had cancer (3 with amphiphysin autoimmunity and breast carcinoma and 2 with Hodgkin lymphoma). Excluding patients with PERM, all patients but 1 had sustained improvements with at least 1 gamma-aminobutyric acid agent, usually diazepam; the median dosage for patients with classic SMS was 40.0 mg/d. Additional improvements occurred among 14 of 34 patients (41%) who received immunotherapy (intravenous immune globulin, azathioprine, prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, or cyclophosphamide). Sixteen of 25 patients (64%) with extended follow-up duration remained ambulatory., CONCLUSIONS: Recognition of classic SMS vs variants is important because appropriate therapy improves symptoms in most patients. Classification by anatomical extent and by GAD65 antibody serostatus gives important diagnostic and prognostic information.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is an uncommon yet under-diagnosed, neuromuscular disorder characterised by progressive muscle rigidity with superimposed painful muscle spasms triggered by tactile, auditory or emotional stimulation. We describe the world's first case report of typical SPS in a patient with previously excised thymoma and treated non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This is of relevance because of the increasingly elucidated autoimmune aetiology of SPS. Copyright © 2012 The Authors. Internal Medicine Journal © 2012 Royal Australasian College of Physicians.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare immune-mediated disorder of the central nervous system characterized by muscle rigidity and episodic muscle spasms. The diagnosis of SPS is based on electrophysiological studies. We analyzed the electrophysiological features in four patients from Brazil who fulfilled the clinical criteria for SPS. The most common electrophysiological abnormalities were continuous motor unit activity, co-contracting, and the presence of the cutaneomuscular reflex. Despite all patients having clinical characteristics of SPS during the disease, no patient met all the electrophysiological criteria for SPS even after repeat electrophysiological studies. This shows that a diagnosis of SPS should not be restricted to patients with all the classic electrophysiological changes but should be considered in the presence of one or some of those changes.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a disabling autoimmune central nervous system disorder characterized by progressive muscle rigidity and gait impairment with superimposed painful spasms that involve axial and limb musculature, triggered by heightened sensitivity to external stimuli. Impaired synaptic GABAergic inhibition resulting from intrathecal B-cell-mediated clonal synthesis of autoantibodies against various presynaptic and synaptic proteins in the inhibitory neurons of the brain and spinal cord is believed to be an underlying pathogenic mechanism. SPS is most often idiopathic, but it can occur as a paraneoplastic condition. Despite evidence that anti-GAD and related autoantibodies impair GABA synthesis, the exact pathogenic mechanism of SPS is not fully elucidated. The strong association with several MHC-II alleles and improvement of symptoms with immune-modulating therapies support an autoimmune etiology of SPS. In this review, we discuss the clinical spectrum, neurophysiological mechanisms, and therapeutic options, including a rationale for agents that modulate B-cell function in SPS.

AB  - UNLABELLED: High prevalence of autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-Ab) in stiff man syndrome (SMS) not only helps diagnosis, but also suggests immune mediated impairment of GABAergic functions. However, the presence of GAD-Ab has also been reported in other neurological syndromes. Therefore the prevalence of GAD-Ab was investigated in SMS, progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM), and in other neurological diseases (OND). Serum antibodies against the GAD isoforms, GAD65 and GAD67, were investigated with radioimmunoassays in 13 patients with SMS, nine with PERM, 279 consecutive patients with OND, and in 100 normal controls., RESULTS: Prevalence of GAD65Ab was around 80% in patients with SMS/PERM compared with 5% in patients with OND and 1% in normal controls. Prevalence of GAD67Ab was 60% in SMS/PERM, 2% in patients with OND, and 1% in normal controls. Raised GAD-Ab clustered in an OND subgroup with sporadic progressive ataxia, but not in OND subgroups with recognised neuroimmunological diseases. In conclusion, increased GAD-Ab is neither a non-specific epiphenomenon of neuronal damage nor a common feature of recognised neuroimmunological disorders. In neurological diseases, GAD-Ab may be a pathogenetic agent or a marker for an ongoing autoimmune process, or both.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the specificity of anti-GAD(65) antibodies in patients with stiff person syndrome (SPS), quantify antibody titers, and examine antibody production within the CNS., METHODS: The authors studied 18 patients with SPS and positive serum immunoreactivity to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic neurons. The reactivity of serum and CSF to purified GAD antigen was examined by Western blots, and the anti-GAD(65) antibody titers in serum and CSF were quantified by ELISA and compared with 70 disease controls (49 with other autoimmune disorders and 11 with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus). The intrathecal synthesis of anti-GAD(65) IgG was calculated, and the functional significance of the antibodies was examined by measuring the GABA levels in the CSF., RESULTS: The serum and CSF of all selected patients with SPS had high anti-GAD(65) titers (from 7.0 to 215 microg/mL in serum and from 92 to 2500 ng/mL in CSF) and immunoreacted strongly with recombinant GAD(65) on Western blots and with GABA-ergic neurons on rat cerebellum. Among controls, only the serum of eight patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus had low anti-GAD(65) antibody titers (from 200 to 1760 ng/mL) but no reactivity to recombinant GAD(65). The CSF showed oligoclonal IgG bands in 10 (67%) of 15 patients and an increased anti-GAD(65)-specific IgG index in 11 (85%) of 13. The mean level of GABA in the CSF was lower in patients with SPS than in controls., CONCLUSIONS: In patients with SPS, there is marked intrathecal antibody response against neuronal GAD(65) epitopes, indicating a clonal B cell activation in the CNS. Anti-GAD(65) antibodies at high titers, when confirmed with immunoblots, are highly specific for SPS and appear to impair GABA synthesis.

AB  - Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) is the main target of humoral autoimmunity in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and stiff-person syndrome. We reviewed the case of a 46-year-old woman who had cerebellar ataxia before getting stiff-person syndrome and IDDM with high anti-GAD autoantibody titers. This was a rare case in which there were both the clinical symptoms of stiff-person syndrome and cerebellar ataxia. In western blot analysis her serum reacted with 65-kDa proteins from rat cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and spinal cord. Autoantibodies to GAD may cause functional impairment of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons in the spinal cord as well as in the cerebellum.

AB  - We report a case of a 40-year-old female with continuous muscle stiffness and painful muscle spasms. The symptoms worsened over a two-week period after onset. Electrophysiological examinations revealed continuous muscle discharge, which was markedly reduced by intravenous administration of diazepam. High levels of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies were detected in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid, suggesting that the patient suffered from stiff-person syndrome. Steroid pulse therapy and immunoadsorption therapy alleviated the clinical symptoms and decreased the anti-GAD antibody titer. A chest CT revealed the presence of an invasive thymoma. Neither anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies nor symptoms of myasthenia gravis (MG) were observed. The patient underwent a thymectomy and postoperative radiotherapy. These treatments further alleviated the clinical symptoms. The present case is the first that associates stiff-person syndrome with invasive thymoma, and not accompanied by MG. The autoimmune mechanism, in this case, may be triggered by the invasive thymoma.

There were no signs of truncal rigidity or exaggerated lumbar lordosis. Anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies were positive in her serum. She improved substantially with clonazepam 4 mg/day. She presented with electrophysiological findings not previously reported in stiff leg syndrome, which may suggest increased inhibition in the uninvolved upper extremities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stiff-person syndrome is a disabling central nervous system disorder with no satisfactory treatment that is characterized by muscle rigidity, episodic muscle spasms, high titers of antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), and a frequent association with autoimmune disorders. Because stiff-person syndrome is most likely immune-mediated, we evaluated the efficacy of intravenous immune globulin., METHODS: We assigned 16 patients who had stiff-person syndrome and anti-GAD65 antibodies, in random order, to receive intravenous immune globulin or placebo for three months, followed by a one-month washout period and then by three months of therapy with the alternative agent. Efficacy was judged by improvements in scores on the distribution-of-stiffness index and heightened-sensitivity scale from base line (month 1) to the second and third month of each treatment phase. Direct and carryover effects of treatment were compared in the two groups., RESULTS: Among patients who received immune globulin first, stiffness scores decreased significantly (P=0.02) and heightened-sensitivity scores decreased substantially during immune globulin therapy but rebounded during placebo administration. In contrast, the scores in the group that received placebo first remained constant during placebo administration but dropped significantly during immune globulin therapy (P=0.01). When the data were analyzed for a direct and a first-order carryover effect, there was a significant difference in stiffness scores (P=0.01 and P<0.001, respectively) between the immune globulin and placebo groups, and immune globulin therapy had a significant direct treatment effect on sensitivity scores (P=0.03). Eleven patients who received immune globulin became able to walk more easily or without assistance, their frequency of falls decreased, and they were able to perform work-related or household tasks. The duration of the beneficial effects of immune globulin varied from six weeks to one year. Anti-GAD65 antibody titers declined after immune globulin therapy but not after placebo administration., CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous immune globulin is a well-tolerated and effective, albeit costly, therapy for patients with stiff-person syndrome and anti-GAD65 antibodies.

AB  - Diagnosis criteria of stiff-person syndrome (SPS) include progressive, fluctuating muscular rigidity and spasms with normal neurological examination. The presence of unusual features such as prominent limb rigidity with segmental signs and contracture, evidence of brainstem dysfunction, profound autonomic disturbances, CSF pleiocytosis or MRI abnormalities in patients with SPS presentation allows to classify these patients as progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity (PER). We report a 50 year-old woman suffering from severe painful spasms of abdominal wall and limb muscles. Neurological examination showed pyramidal signs. EMG disclosed continuous muscle activity with superimposed discharges. Treatment with high doses of diazepam and baclofen led to moderate improvement of generalised stiffness. However, the right arm became more rigid with oedema and vasomotor changes. Subsequently, bilateral nystagmus and internuclear opthalmplegia appeared. There was mild CSF pleiocytosis. Associated auto-immune thyroiditis was found with positive anti-microsome antibodies and decreased thyroid hormones. Search for profound neoplasm was negative. The patient had three subacute bouts then she improved with methylprednisolone. The initial clinical presentation mimicking a SPS with subsequent diffuse involvement of the central nervous system and a striking localisation of a severe rigidity to one arm allowed to suspect the diagnosis of PER. The relationship between SPS and PER remains unclear because of the rarity of these disorders. The observation reported in this paper gives evidence that both the disorders are probably two clinical presentations of the same pathogenic process.

Post mortem examination revealed perivascular lymphocyte cuffing throughout the cerebral hemispheres, brainstem and spinal cord and neuronal loss in medial anterior horns of the cervical spinal cord. These findings support the notion that the SMS and progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity (PER) form a clinical and pathologic continuum. Copyright 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The therapeutic effects of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) on the stiff-person syndrome (SPS) have been described exclusively in case reports or open-label studies in terms of clinical outcomes. We investigate whether IVIG improves quality of life (QoL) in the SPS. Six patients with the classic form of SPS completed a generic QoL instrument, the SF-36, and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) before treatment as well as 2 weeks after completion of a course of IVIG. There was significant improvement in the SF-36 subscores for pain, social functioning, general mental health, and energy-vitality with treatment. The VAS also improved significantly. We conclude that treatment with IVIG improves QoL in the SPS. Copyright 2002 Movement Disorder Society.

AB  - The recovery cycle of the R2 component of the blink reflex was studied in five patients with stiff-person syndrome (SPS) and in seven healthy control subjects. R2 recovery was enhanced in patients with SPS. This result is suggestive of hyperexcitability of brainstem interneuronal circuits in SPS. Hyperexcitability may result from abnormal input from suprasegmental structures or loss of inhibition by interneurons and is compatible with the proposal that there is a widespread dysfunction of central inhibitory mechanisms in SPS.

AB  - Stiff-man syndrome (SMS) is a rare autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system associated with autoantibodies to glutamate decarboxylase (GAD). We isolated five brain-reactive human monoclonal antibodies, with reactivity distinct from GAD, from peripheral blood of a patient newly diagnosed with SMS. Two antibodies reacted with both Purkinje cells and ependymal cells, and precipitated an 80-kDa protein from rat neuronal primary cultures, which was also recognized by 12% (3/25) of SMS sera and 13% (2/15) of SMS cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. The corresponding antigen was identified as 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 4 and may represent a possible novel target of autoimmunity in SMS.

On examination, she exhibited severe stiffness and intermittent extensor spasms of the lower extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed T2 hyperintensity in the left temporal lobe with enhancement after gadolinium administration on T1-weighted images. Amphiphysin antibodies were present in the serum. Radiographic screening for malignancy disclosed a metastatic breast cancer. The case is a unique example of amphiphysin autoimmunity, illustrating the possibility of paraneoplastic stiff-person syndrome and limbic encephalitis coexisting in a patient with a "classical" presentation of stiff-person syndrome confined to the lower extremities.

AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is an uncommon and disabling disorder characterized by progressive rigidity and episodic painful spasms involving axial and limb musculature. SPS treatment is mostly based on benzodiazepines, baclofen, immunosuppressants and intravenous immunoglobulin. Cannabis derivatives [tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD)] are available as an oromucosal spray (Sativex( R)), indicated as add-on treatment, for symptom improvement in patients with moderate to severe spasticity because of multiple sclerosis (MS). Our objective is to report a case of seronegative SPS successfully treated with THC-CBD oromucosal spray., CASE SUMMARY: We report a case of a 40-year-old man presenting with progressive muscle stiffness and intermittent spasms for 6-years. The diagnosis of stiff-person syndrome was based on the clinical features and neuroelectrophysiologic findings of continuous motor unit activity. Glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies was absent in our patient, in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Cannabis derivatives oromucosal spray was introduced after a series of unsatisfactory traditional medical treatments. After 14 months treated with THC-CBD oromucosal spray, improvement was verified in the eight dimensions of the scale of SF-36 quality of life questionnaire., WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Clinical experience with cannabis derivatives in patients with multiple sclerosis is accumulating steadily, but there is no current literature about its efficacy for SPS. Because MS and SPS share some neurological symptoms such as spasticity and rigidity, it is thought that THC-CBC can be an option for SPS patient. Our case report suggests that THC-CBD oromucosal spray is an alternative treatment for patients with refractory SPS, and further validation is appropriate. Copyright © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Parainfectious or autoimmune striatal lesions have been repeatedly described in children. We report a 7-year-old girl with painful muscle spasms, leading to the diagnosis of childhood stiff-person syndrome (SPS). Striatal lesions were demonstrated by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single-photon emission computed tomography but not by conventional MRI. Autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) were absent. Steroid pulse therapy and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin resolved all the symptoms with slight sequelae. Childhood SPS may be characterized by absent anti-GAD antibodies and a transient benign clinical course, and it may have a pathomechanism distinct from that in adult SPS.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether glycine receptor alpha1 subunit-specific autoantibodies (GlyRalpha1-IgG) occur in a broader spectrum of brainstem and spinal hyperexcitability disorders than the progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus phenotype recognized to date, and to ascertain disease specificity., DESIGN: Retrospective, case-control study., SETTINGS: Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, and University of Barcelona, Spain., PATIENTS: Eighty-one patients with stiff-man syndrome phenotype, 80 neurologic control subjects, and 20 healthy control subjects., INTERVENTION: Glycine receptor alpha1-transfected cells to test serum or cerebrospinal fluid from cases and control subjects., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of GlyRalpha1-IgG positivity among stiff-man syndrome phenotype cases and control subjects. Comparison of GlyRalpha1-IgG seropositive and seronegative cases., RESULTS: Seropositive cases (12% of cases) included 9 with stiff-man syndrome (4 classic; 5 variant; 66% were glutamic acid decarboxylase 65-IgG positive) and 1 with progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus. Immunotherapy responses were noted more frequently in GlyRalpha1-IgG-positive cases (6 of 7 improved) than in seronegative cases (7 of 25 improved; P= .02). The single seropositive control patient had steroid-responsive vision loss and optic atrophy with inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid., CONCLUSIONS: Glycine receptor alpha1-IgG aids identification of autoimmune brainstem/spinal cord hyperexcitability disorders and may extend to the glycinergic visual system.

AB  - Hyperekplexia manifests as generalized stiffness and an excessive startle reflex to stimuli. It starts in the neonatal period and is transmitted in many cases via autosomal dominant inheritance. The etiology is an abnormality of the glycinergic neurotransmission system that is involved in inhibitory neurotransmission. Aberrations of five genes related to this neurotransmission system have been identified. The patient was a 14-year-old girl with mild mental retardation. None of her family members had a neuromuscular disease. An excessive startle reflex and generalized stiffness were noted immediately after birth and she was diagnosed with epilepsy because epileptic discharges were observed. However, the disease was resistant to various antiepileptic drugs and the startle responses persisted. GLRB gene mutations (R50X/Q216fsx222) were identified, after which the patient was diagnosed with hyperekplexia. The startle reflex improved when clonazepam treatment was initiated. When patients have a persistent startle reflex, it is necessary to consider hyperekplexia, even if epileptic discharges are observed. Only four cases with GLRB mutations, including the present patient, have been reported. To make a definite diagnosis of hyperekplexia, it may be useful to screen for genes that are involved in the glycinergic neurotransmission system.

AB  - Previous studies have indicated phenotypical differences in glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 autoantibodies (GADA) found in type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients, individuals at risk of developing T1D and stiff-person syndrome (SPS) patients. In a Phase II trial using aluminium-formulated GAD(65) (GAD-alum) as an immunomodulator in T1D, several patients responded with high GADA titres after treatment, raising concerns as to whether GAD-alum could induce GADA with SPS-associated phenotypes. This study aimed to analyse GADA levels, immunoglobulin (Ig)G1-4 subclass frequencies, b78- and b96.11-defined epitope distribution and GAD(65) enzyme activity in sera from four cohorts with very high GADA titres: T1D patients (n = 7), GAD-alum-treated T1D patients (n = 9), T1D high-risk individuals (n = 6) and SPS patients (n = 12). SPS patients showed significantly higher GADA levels and inhibited the in-vitro GAD(65) enzyme activity more strongly compared to the other groups. A higher binding frequency to the b78-defined epitope was found in the SPS group compared to T1D and GAD-alum individuals, whereas no differences were detected for the b96.11-defined epitope. GADA IgG1-4 subclass levels did not differ between the groups, but SPS patients had higher IgG2 and lower IgG4 distribution more frequently. In conclusion, the in-vitro GADA phenotypes from SPS patients differed from the T1D- and high-risk groups, and GAD-alum treatment did not induce SPS-associated phenotypes. However, occasional overlap between the groups exists, and caution is indicated when drawing conclusions to health or disease status. Copyright © 2012 British Society for Immunology.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: To better characterize progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) syndrome and identify novel PERM phenotypes., METHODS: The clinical features and antibody status of PERM patients were investigated using immunoblots, cell-based assays, RIA, protein macroarray and ELISA., RESULTS: Two patients with supratentorial involvement showed abnormal PET or EEG findings. One patient was discovered to have renal cell carcinoma, and protein macroarray revealed Ma3-antibodies. Another patient with leucine-rich, glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies showed a good response to immunotherapy., CONCLUSION: The heterogeneity of the immunological features suggests that PERM is caused by diverse pathogenic mechanisms. Seropositivity to well-characterized neuronal cell surface antigens might indicate a good treatment response. Copyright © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Stiff man syndrome is a rare disease characterized by painful chronic spasms in the muscle and skeletal system. This syndrome is an autoimmune neurologic disorder which is associated with thymoma. We treated a 32-year-old male patient with a type C thymoma (based on the World Health Organization classification) who had stiff man syndrome. The patient underwent an extended thymectomy which brought about alleviation of his symptoms.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare disorder of the central nervous system characterized by stiffness and muscle spasms that may be progressive in nature. When oral medication is inadequate to control muscle spasticity, intrathecal baclofen may be used. We report a patient with severe SPS and glutamate decarboxylase negative [GAD(-)] (note: GAD(-) indicates the patient has no antibodies to GAD), refractory to oral standard therapies. The patient was effectively trialed with an intrathecal catheter and subsequently treated with chronic intrathecal baclofen, which provided significant relief of spasticity symptoms., CASE REPORT: A 48-year-old white man with a history consistent with SPS presented to the clinic. His previous history showed that he met several diagnostic criteria for GAD(-) SPS and had a muscle biopsy positive for myositis. Oral medications were unable to control his muscle spasticity, preventing him from working. The patient received an intrathecal trial using a lumbar approach for placement of a thoracic catheter with an initial baclofen dose of 50 mug/d. Gradual titration to symptom relief was performed up to 150 mug/d. Functional evaluation by our physical therapist showed improved motor function, the temporary catheter was removed, and a permanent intrathecal pump placed for intrathecal baclofen infusion. The patient reported excellent symptom relief over the next 6 months and improved activity., CONCLUSIONS: Refractory SPS is difficult to treat and has few therapeutic options. We report a GAD(-) patient with SPS and resulting debilitating spasticity that was refractory to oral medications who underwent successful continuous intrathecal catheter trial of baclofen over 4 days and subsequently went on to implantation of intrathecal pump. The literature reports only 5 cases of GAD(-) SPS patients treated with intrathecal baclofen therapy, and these resulted in poor long-term success. Our patient completed a 4-day trial of intrathecal baclofen titrated to effect before pump implantation. We advocate continuous intrathecal trialing, as opposed to single-injection technique, to possibly better determine the effective therapeutic dose and ensure posttrialing successful therapy.

AB  - We report a 61-year-old man presenting with rapidly progressive stiffness and painful muscle spasms in the lower extremity muscles. The patient was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) approximately a year before symptom onset. Electromyography displayed continuous motor unit activity and immunocytochemistry showed a positive staining for antiglycine receptor (anti-GlyR) antibodies. The clinical course was complicated by autonomic instability and cardiac arrest, but stabilised under continuous therapy with plasma exchange and symptomatic treatment with baclofen and clonazepam. Anti-GlyR antibodies induce rare, but severe, variants of stiff person syndrome that can be of paraneoplastic origin and life threatening due to autonomic dysfunction.

AB  - A 39-year-old man (a lifetime non-smoker) presented with a locked left jaw and leg myoclonus. Clinical and electromyographic findings were in keeping with progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) syndrome. A thoracic CT scan demonstrated a 19 mm right hilar nodule, which was proven to be small cell lung cancer on bronchoscopic biopsy. Serological evaluation of the patient's plasma revealed antibodies against glycine receptors (serology negative for anti-GAD, anti-Yo, anti-Hu, anti-Ri, antiamphiphysin, anti-Ma2/Ta, anti-CRMP5 and anti-NMDA receptor). After his cancer was treated with chemotherapy and intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg), neurological symptoms resolved but returned several months later without any evidence of cancer recurrence. Symptoms were refractory to corticosteroids and IVIg therapy. Rituximab was then initiated, which led to a dramatic and sustained resolution of symptoms. To our knowledge, this is the first case of PERM related to antiglycine receptor antibodies from paraneoplastic syndrome, which resolved with rituximab.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: High titers of autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are well documented in association with stiff person syndrome (SPS). Glutamic acid decarboxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and impaired function of GABAergic neurons has been implicated in the pathogenesis of SPS. Autoantibodies to GAD might be the causative agent or a disease marker., OBJECTIVE: To investigate the characteristics and potential pathogenicity of GAD autoantibodies in patients with SPS and related disorders., DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study and laboratory investigation., SETTING: Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford., PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-five patients with SPS and related conditions identified from the Neuroimmunology Service., EXPOSURES: Neurological examination, serological characterization and experimental studies., MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Characterization of serum GAD antibodies from patients with SPS and evidence for potential pathogenicity., RESULTS: We detected GAD autoantibodies at a very high titer (median, 7500 U/mL) in 19 patients (76%), including all 12 patients with classic SPS. The GAD autoantibodies were high affinity (antibody dissociation constant, 0.06-0.78 nmol) and predominantly IgG1 subclass. The patients' autoantibodies co-localized with GAD on immunohistochemistry and in permeabilized cultured cerebellar GABAergic neurons, as expected, but they also bound to the cell surface of unpermeabilized GABAergic neurons. Adsorption of the highest titer (700 000 U/mL) serum with recombinant GAD indicated that these neuronal surface antibodies were not directed against GAD itself. Although intraperitoneal injection of IgG purified from the 2 available GAD autoantibody-ositive purified IgG preparations did not produce clinical or pathological evidence of disease, SPS and control IgG were detected in specific regions of the mouse central nervous system, particularly around the lateral and fourth ventricles., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Autoantibodies to GAD are associated with antibodies that bind to the surface of GABAergic neurons and that could be pathogenic. Moreover, in mice, human IgG from the periphery gained access to relevant areas in the hippocampus and brainstem. Identification of the target of the non-GAD antibodies and peripheral and intrathecal transfer protocols, combined with adsorption studies, should be used to demonstrate the role of the non-GAD IgG in SPS.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To refresh clinical diagnostic dilemmas in patients presenting with symptoms resembling to those of parkinsonism, to report rare association of colon cancer and paraneoplastic stiff person syndrome (SPS), and to draw attention on the possible correlation of capecitabine therapy with worsening of paraneoplastic SPS., METHODS: Case report of the patient with paraneoplastic SPS due to colon cancer that was misdiagnosed as idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD), whose symptoms worsened after beginning adjuvant capecitabine chemotherapy., RESULTS: We describe a 55-year-old woman with subacute onset of symmetrical stiffness and rigidity of the truncal and proximal lower limb muscles that caused lower body bradykinesia, gait difficulties, and postural instability. Diagnose of iPD was made and levodopa treatment was initiated but failed to provide beneficial effect. Six months later, colon cancer was discovered and the patient underwent surgical procedure and chemotherapy with capecitabine thereafter. Aggravation of stiffness, rigidity, and low back pain was observed after the first chemotherapy cycle and capecitabine was discontinued. Furthermore, levodopa was slowly discontinued and low dose of diazepam was administered which resulted in partial resolution of the patient's symptoms., CONCLUSION: Paraneoplastic SPS is rare disorder with clinical features resembling those of parkinsonian syndrome and making the correct diagnosis remains a challenge. The diagnosis of parkinsonian syndrome should be re-examined if subsequent examinations discover an associated malignant process. Although it remains unclear whether the patients with history of SPS are at the greater risk for symptoms deterioration after administration of capecitabine, clinicians should be aware of capecitabine side effects because recognition and appropriate management can prevent serious adverse outcomes.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Reports of pediatric-onset stiff-man syndrome (SMS) are rare. This may be an underrecognized disorder in child neurology practice., OBJECTIVE: To describe patients with disorders in the SMS spectrum beginning in childhood., DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study was a medical record review and serological evaluation conducted at child and adult neurology clinics at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. Systematic review of the literature was conducted of patients who presented from 1984-2012 with onset of symptomatic SMS occurring at age 18 years or younger., MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Response to symptomatic and immunotherapies, patient and physician reported, including modified Rankin scale., RESULTS: We identified 8 patients with childhood-onset SMS, representing 5% of patients with SMS evaluated at Mayo Clinic during a period of 29 years (4 were girls). The median age at symptom onset was 11 years (range, 1-14 years). The diagnosis in 3 patients was not established until adulthood (median symptom duration at diagnosis, 14 years; range, 0-46 years). The phenotypes encountered were: classic SMS (n = 5, involving the low back and lower extremities), variant SMS (n = 2, limited to 1 limb [with dystonic posture] or back), and progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (n = 1). Initial misdiagnoses included functional movement disorder (n = 2), generalized dystonia and parkinsonism (n = 1), and hereditary spastic paraparesis (n = 1). Six patients had 1 or more coexisting autoimmune disorders: type 1 diabetes mellitus (n = 4), thyroid disease (n = 2), and vitiligo (n = 2). Serologic study results revealed glutamic acid decarboxylase 65-IgG in all cases (median value, 754 nmol/L; range, 0.06-3847 nmol/L; normal value, <= 0.02 nmol/L) and glycine receptor antibody in 3 cases. Improvements were noted with symptomatic therapy (diazepam, 6 of 6 patients treated, and oral baclofen, 3 of 3 treated) and immunotherapy (intravenous immune globulin, 3 of 4 treated and plasmapheresis, 3 of 4 treated). The 3 patients with glycine receptor antibody all improved with immunotherapy. At last follow-up, 4 patients had mild or no symptoms, but 4 had moderate or severe residual symptoms and required maintenance symptomatic therapy (n = 5) and immunotherapy (n = 4). Ten of 12 pediatric SMS cases identified by literature review had a severe whole-body phenotype resembling progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Childhood-onset SMS is a rare but underrecognized and treatable disorder. Serological and electrophysiological testing aid diagnosis.

AB  - A 34 year old morbidly obese stiffperson syndrome (SPS) patient was scheduled for a permanent catheter placement. SPS is a rare neurologic condition with a suspected autoimmune etiology. SPS most common manifestations are progressive, including severe muscle rigidity or stiffness affecting the spine and lower extremities more than other muscle groups. SPS have superimposed episodic muscle spasms that may resemble myotonic-like contractions and are precipitated by unexpected noises, tactile stimuli, or emotional stress. This case report describes a patient with SPS and morbid obesity, and his subsequent management perioperatively for a permanent catheter placement under monitored anesthesia care. Careful and methodical management of patients with SPS is strongly suggested given their sensitivity to inhalational anesthetics and neuromuscular blockers.

AB  - A 40-year-old man presented with respiratory compromise and was intubated. After tracheostomy, he was found to have ophthalmoplegia, severe limb rigidity, stimulus-sensitive myoclonus and autonomic dysfunction. For 1&emsp14;week before admission, there had been a prodromal illness with low mood, hallucinations and limb myoclonus. Serum glycine receptor antibodies were strongly positive: we diagnosed progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus. Despite a relapse, he has done well following immunotherapies. The clinical syndrome of encephalomyelitis with rigidity, described in 1976, often has a severe progressive course. A minority of patients have glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies. The association with glycine receptor antibody was first reported in 2008, and we briefly review subsequent case reports to illustrate the range of clinical features. The antibody is likely to be disease mediating, although this remains unproven. The spectrum of diagnosable and treatable antibody mediated neurological syndromes is expanding. It is vital to recognise these conditions early to reduce morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Paraneoplastic stiff-person syndrome (SPS) has been associated with antibodies against amphiphysin. Current evidence supports a pathogenic role for anti-amphiphysin antibodies. A 74-year-old female was diagnosed with amphiphysin-associated paraneoplastic stiff-person syndrome and associated encephalomyelitis. She had initial response to IVIG, however her symptoms worsened after two months and were resistant to further treatment. Subsequently the patient died and a post-mortem was performed. Neuropathology revealed perivascular and parenchymal lymphocytic infiltrates, with neuronophagia mediated by CD8+ T cells and microglia in brainstem, spinal cord, and mesial temporal lobe structures. These findings suggest a pathogenic role of cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells, with potential implication for therapy of future patients. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests that seizures and status epilepticus can be immune-mediated. We aimed to describe the clinical features of a new epileptic disorder, and to establish the target antigen and the effects of patients' antibodies on neuronal cultures., METHODS: In this observational study, we selected serum and CSF samples for antigen characterisation from 140 patients with encephalitis, seizures or status epilepticus, and antibodies to unknown neuropil antigens. The samples were obtained from worldwide referrals of patients with disorders suspected to be autoimmune between April 28, 2006, and April 25, 2013. We used samples from 75 healthy individuals and 416 patients with a range of neurological diseases as controls. We assessed the samples using immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, cell-based assay, and analysis of antibody effects in cultured rat hippocampal neurons with confocal microscopy., FINDINGS: Neuronal cell-membrane immunoprecipitation with serum of two index patients revealed GABAA receptor sequences. Cell-based assay with HEK293 expressing alpha1/beta3 subunits of the GABAA receptor showed high titre serum antibodies (>1:160) and CSF antibodies in six patients. All six patients (age 3-63 years, median 22 years; five male patients) developed refractory status epilepticus or epilepsia partialis continua along with extensive cortical-subcortical MRI abnormalities; four patients needed pharmacologically induced coma. 12 of 416 control patients with other diseases, but none of the healthy controls, had low-titre GABAA receptor antibodies detectable in only serum samples, five of them also had GAD-65 antibodies. These 12 patients (age 2-74 years, median 26.5 years; seven male patients) developed a broader spectrum of symptoms probably indicative of coexisting autoimmune disorders: six had encephalitis with seizures (one with status epilepticus needing pharmacologically induced coma; one with epilepsia partialis continua), four had stiff-person syndrome (one with seizures and limbic involvement), and two had opsoclonus-myoclonus. Overall, 12 of 15 patients for whom treatment and outcome were assessable had full (three patients) or partial (nine patients) response to immunotherapy or symptomatic treatment, and three died. Patients' antibodies caused a selective reduction of GABAA receptor clusters at synapses, but not along dendrites, without altering NMDA receptors and gephyrin (a protein that anchors the GABAA receptor)., INTERPRETATION: High titres of serum and CSF GABAA receptor antibodies are associated with a severe form of encephalitis with seizures, refractory status epilepticus, or both. The antibodies cause a selective reduction of synaptic GABAA receptors. The disorder often occurs with GABAergic and other coexisting autoimmune disorders and is potentially treatable., FUNDING: The National Institutes of Health, the McKnight Neuroscience of Brain Disorders, the Fondo de Investigaciones Sanitarias, Fundacio la Marato de TV3, the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (Veni-incentive), the Dutch Epilepsy Foundation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) in stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is unclear., STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with SPS who underwent TPE and a systematic literature review were conducted., RESULTS: Nine patients with the presumptive diagnosis of SPS who underwent TPE were identified. The mean age was 55 years (range, 34-72 years) and 78% (n = 7) were female. Anti-GAD65 was present in 89% (n = 8) of the patients (range, 1.9-40,000 U/mL), and 33% (n = 3) had a history of diabetes. Forty-four percent (n = 4) of patients had previously received immunosuppressive medication and 67% (n = 6) received intravenous immune globulin. The main indication for TPE was worsening of symptoms despite treatment with first-line therapy. Seventy-eight percent of the patients (n = 7) had five TPE procedures. Seventy-eight percent (n = 7) of patients demonstrated at least minimal clinical improvement and 56% (n = 5) had a significant response. Most of the patients who demonstrated a significant response to treatment improved and their symptoms stabilized. Two patients (22%) developed adverse events, including catheter-associated infection and transient hypotension. Eighteen publications were found from the literature review, which resulted in a total of 26 patients diagnosed with SPS. Forty-two percent (n = 11) of patients had a significant symptomatic improvement after TPE treatment, and two patients (8%) developed adverse events., CONCLUSION: TPE may benefit patients with SPS who are not responsive to first-line therapy, and it is well tolerated.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a novel and distinct variant of progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) associated with antibodies directed against dipeptidyl peptidase-like protein 6 (DPPX), a regulatory subunit of the Kv4.2 potassium channels on the surface of neurons., METHODS: Case series describing the clinical, paraclinical, and serologic features of 3 patients with PERM. A recombinant, cell-based indirect immunofluorescence assay with DPPX-expressing HEK293 cells was used to detect DPPX antibodies in conjunction with mammalian tissues., RESULTS: All patients presented with a distinct syndrome involving hyperekplexia, prominent cerebellar ataxia with marked eye movement disorder, and trunk stiffness of variable intensity. Additional symptoms comprised allodynia, neurogenic pruritus, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Symptoms began insidiously and progressed slowly. An inflammatory CSF profile with mild pleocytosis and intrathecal immunoglobulin G synthesis was found in all patients. High DPPX antibody titers were detected in the patients' serum and CSF, with specific antibody indices suggestive of intrathecal synthesis of DPPX antibodies. Response to immunotherapy was good, but constant and aggressive treatment may be required., CONCLUSION: These cases highlight the expanding spectrum of both PERM and anti-neuronal antibodies. Testing for DPPX antibodies should be considered in the diagnostic workup of patients with acquired hyperekplexia, cerebellar ataxia, and stiffness, because such patients might benefit from immunotherapy. Further studies are needed to elucidate both the entire clinical spectrum associated with DPPX antibodies and their role in pathogenesis.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare condition that causes rigidity in the muscles of the body and extremities, difficulty in walking, episodic spasms and progressive disability. SPS is generally seen together with autoimmune disorders such as diabetes mellitus, thyroiditis, vitiligo and pernicious anaemia. Rarely, it may develop as a paraneoplastic condition. SPS cases associated with breast cancer, small cell lung carcinoma, thymoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma and colorectal cancer have been reported in the literature. We present a case of a 58-year-old female patient who had malignant mesothelioma-associated SPS. Patients who have muscle spasms and difficulty in movement of joints should be evaluated for SPS before diagnosis of Parkinson's or other neurological disorders, and possible underlying malignancies should be excluded.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (formerly known as stiff-man syndrome) is a very rare autoimmune and neurogenic disorder, thought to present as a paraneoplastic variant in association with thymoma. Pure red blood cell aplasia is also a paraneoplastic disorder associated with thymoma. Although separate cases of stiff-person syndrome and pure red blood cell aplasia have been reported, we describe here what is to our knowledge the first case of recurrent thymoma with both stiff-person syndrome and pure red blood cell aplasia. We describe the successful treatment of the neurogenic symptoms of stiff-person syndrome and the progressive anemia associated with pure red blood cell aplasia by tumor excision.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Current clinical and immunologic knowledge on cerebellar ataxia (CA) with glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 antibodies (GAD65-Abs) is based on case reports and small series with short-term follow-up data., OBJECTIVE: To report the symptoms, additional antibodies, prognostic factors, and long-term outcomes in a cohort of patients with CA and GAD65-Abs., DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study and laboratory investigations at a center for autoimmune neurologic disorders among 34 patients with CA and GAD65-Abs, including 25 with long-term follow-up data (median, 5.4 years; interquartile range, 3.1-10.3 years)., MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Analysis of clinicoimmunologic features and predictors of response to immunotherapy. Immunochemistry on rat brain, cultured neurons, and human embryonic kidney cells expressing GAD65, GAD67, alpha1-subunit of the glycine receptor, and a repertoire of known cell surface autoantigens were used to identify additional antibodies. Twenty-eight patients with stiff person syndrome and GAD65-Abs served as controls., RESULTS: The median age of patients was 58 years (range, 33-80 years); 28 of 34 patients (82%) were women. Nine patients (26%) reported episodes of brainstem and cerebellar dysfunction or persistent vertigo several months before developing CA. The clinical presentation was subacute during a period of weeks in 13 patients (38%). Nine patients (26%) had coexisting stiff person syndrome symptoms. Systemic organ-specific autoimmunities (type 1 diabetes mellitus and others) were present in 29 patients (85%). Twenty of 25 patients with long-term follow-up data received immunotherapy (intravenous immunoglobulin in 10 and corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin or other immunosuppressors in 10), and 7 of them (35%) improved. Predictors of clinical response included subacute onset of CA (odds ratio [OR], 0.50; 95% CI, 0.25-0.99; P = .047) and prompt immunotherapy (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96-0.99; P = .01). Similar frequencies of serum GAD67-Abs were found in patients with CA (24 of 34 patients [71%]) and in patients with stiff person syndrome (20 of 28 patients [71%]). However, GAD67-Abs were found in all of the cerebrospinal fluid samples examined (22 samples from patients with CA and 17 samples from patients with stiff person syndrome). Glycine receptor antibodies but not other cell surface antibodies were identified in 4 patients with CA. The presence of glycine receptor antibodies did not correlate with any specific clinical feature., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In patients with CA and GAD65-Abs, subacute onset of symptoms and prompt immunotherapy are associated with good outcome. Persistent vertigo or brainstem and cerebellar episodes can herald CA and should lead to GAD65-Ab testing, particularly in patients with systemic organ-specific autoimmunities.

AB  - The clinical associations of glycine receptor antibodies have not yet been described fully. We identified prospectively 52 antibody-positive patients and collated their clinical features, investigations and immunotherapy responses. Serum glycine receptor antibody endpoint titres ranged from 1:20 to 1:60 000. In 11 paired samples, serum levels were higher than (n = 10) or equal to (n = 1) cerebrospinal fluid levels; there was intrathecal synthesis of glycine receptor antibodies in each of the six pairs available for detailed study. Four patients also had high glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (>1000 U/ml), and one had high voltage-gated potassium channel-complex antibody (2442 pM). Seven patients with very low titres (<1:50) and unknown or alternative diagnoses were excluded from further study. Three of the remaining 45 patients had newly-identified thymomas and one had a lymphoma. Thirty-three patients were classified as progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus, and two as stiff person syndrome; five had a limbic encephalitis or epileptic encephalopathy, two had brainstem features mainly, two had demyelinating optic neuropathies and one had an unclear diagnosis. Four patients (9%) died during the acute disease, but most showed marked improvement with immunotherapies. At most recent follow-up, (2-7 years, median 3 years, since first antibody detection), the median modified Rankin scale scores (excluding the four deaths) decreased from 5 at maximal severity to 1 (P < 0.0001), but relapses have occurred in five patients and a proportion are on reducing steroids or other maintenance immunotherapies as well as symptomatic treatments. The glycine receptor antibodies activated complement on glycine receptor-transfected human embryonic kidney cells at room temperature, and caused internalization and lysosomal degradation of the glycine receptors at 37degreeC. Immunoglobulin G antibodies bound to rodent spinal cord and brainstem co-localizing with monoclonal antibodies to glycine receptor-alpha1. Ten glycine receptor antibody positive samples were also identified in a retrospective cohort of 56 patients with stiff person syndrome and related syndromes. Glycine receptor antibodies are strongly associated with spinal and brainstem disorders, and the majority of patients have progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus. The antibodies demonstrate in vitro evidence of pathogenicity and the patients respond well to immunotherapies, contrasting with earlier studies of this syndrome, which indicated a poor prognosis. The presence of glycine receptor antibodies should help to identify a disease that responds to immunotherapies, but these treatments may need to be sustained, relapses can occur and maintenance immunosuppression may be required.

AB  - Celiac disease--in its typical form--is a chronic immune-mediated enteropathy with typical clinical symptoms that develops against gliadin content of cereal grains, and is often associated with other autoimmune diseases. In cases of atypical manifestation classic symptoms may be absent or mild, and extra-intestinal symptoms or associated syndromes dominate clinical picture. The authors present a longitudinal follow-up of such a case. A 63-years old woman was diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of 19, and with progressive limb ataxia at the age of 36, which was initially thought to be caused by cerebellar atrophy, later probably by stiff person syndrome. At the age 59, her diabetes mellitus manifested with type 2 diabetic phenotype, but based on GAD positivity later was reclassified as type 1 diabetes. Only the last check-up discovered the celiac disease, retrospectively explaining the entire disease course and neurological symptoms. By presenting this case, the authors would like to draw attention to the fact that one should think of the possibility of celiac disease when cerebellar ataxia, progressive neurological symptoms and diabetes are present at the same time. An early diagnosis may help to delay the progression of disease and help better treatment.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurological disease causing significant functional disability for patients and presenting a therapeutic challenge for clinicians. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) has been used successfully to remit autoimmune-mediated neurological diseases. We report 2 cases of severe SPS treated with auto-HSCT, a novel therapy for this disease., OBSERVATIONS: Two anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody-positive patients with SPS had an autologous hematopoietic stem cell graft collected and stored. Subsequently, the patients underwent auto-HSCT. Both patients achieved clinical remission with sustained, marked improvement in symptoms and a return to premorbid functioning, now more than 2.5 and 4.5 years after the procedure., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Stiff person syndrome represents a novel indication for auto-HSCT. The resolution of clinical manifestations of SPS despite the persistence of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies following auto-HSCT suggests that the antibody does not play a direct role in pathogenesis of SPS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the detection frequency and clinical associations of immunoglobulin G (IgG) targeting dipeptidyl-peptidase-like protein-6 (DPPX), a regulatory subunit of neuronal Kv4.2 potassium channels., METHODS: Specimens from 20 patients evaluated on a service basis by tissue-based immunofluorescence yielded a synaptic immunostaining pattern consistent with DPPX-IgG (serum, 20; CSF, all 7 available). Transfected HEK293 cell-based assay confirmed DPPX specificity in all specimens. Sixty-nine patients with stiff-person syndrome and related disorders were also evaluated by DPPX-IgG cell-based assay., RESULTS: Of 20 seropositive patients, 12 were men; median symptom onset age was 53 years (range, 13-75). Symptom onset was insidious in 15 and subacute in 5. Twelve patients reported prodromal weight loss. Neurologic disorders were multifocal. All had one or more brain or brainstem manifestations: amnesia (16), delirium (8), psychosis (4), depression (4), seizures (2), and brainstem disorders (15; eye movement disturbances [8], ataxia [7], dysphagia [6], dysarthria [4], respiratory failure [3]). Nine patients reported sleep disturbance. Manifestations of central hyperexcitability included myoclonus (8), exaggerated startle (6), diffuse rigidity (6), and hyperreflexia (6). Dysautonomia involved the gastrointestinal tract (9; diarrhea [6], gastroparesis, and constipation [3]), bladder (7), cardiac conduction system (3), and thermoregulation (1). Two patients had B-cell neoplasms: gastrointestinal lymphoma (1), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (1). Substantial neurologic improvements followed immunotherapy in 7 of 11 patients with available treatment data. DPPX-IgG was not detected in any of the stiff-person syndrome patients., CONCLUSIONS: DPPX-IgG is a biomarker for an immunotherapy-responsive multifocal neurologic disorder of the central and autonomic nervous systems.

AB  - We present two patients with partial epilepsy, type-1 diabetes and stiff person syndrome associated with high serum auto-antibody levels to glutamate-decarboxylase (anti-GAD). Both patients were or have suffered from additional autoimmune conditions. The presence of stiff person syndrome and elevated anti-GAD levels have to make clinicians look for additional autoimmune conditions including type-1 diabetes. On the other hand, the co-morbidity of partial epilepsy with autoimmune conditions in patients with elevated serum anti-GAD suggests an autoimmune mechanism of partial epilepsy in these cases.

AB  - Corticobasal syndrome (CBS) is associated with asymmetrical rigidity as well as asymmetrical limb-kinetic and ideomotor apraxia. Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is characterized by muscle stiffness and gait difficulties. Whereas patients with CBS have several forms of pathology, many patients with SPS have glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GAD-ab), but these 2 disorders have not been reported to coexist. We report 2 patients with GAD-ab-positive SPS who also had signs suggestive of CBS, including asymmetrical limb rigidity associated with both asymmetrical limb-kinetic and ideomotor apraxia. Future studies should evaluate patients with CBS for GAD-ab and people with SPS for signs of CBS. Copyright © 2014 American Neurological Association.

We present a case of a 48-year-old male patient with SPS who experienced facial and neck muscle spasms that were uncontrolled with oral medications and the use of an intrathecal baclofen pump. Botulinum toxin A injections into the bilateral masseter and neck paraspinal muscles provided pain relief and spasm control, illustrating the use of botulinum toxin A injections in the small muscles of face and neck in patients with SPS.

AB  - Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS), typified by rigidity in muscles of the torso and extremities and painful episodic spasms, is a rare autoimmune-based neurological disease. Here we present the successful endotracheal intubation and application of TIVA without muscle relaxants on an SPS patient. A 46 years old male patient was operated with ASA-II physical status because of lumber vertebral compression fracture. After induction of anesthesia using lidocaine, propofol and remifentanil tracheal intubation was completed easily without neuromuscular blockage. Anesthesia was maintained with propofol, remifentanil and O2/air mixture. After a problem-free intraoperative period the patient was extubated and seven days later was discharged walking with aid. Though the mechanism is not clear neuromuscular blockers and volatile anesthetics may cause prolonged hypotonia in patients with SPS. We think the TIVA technique, a general anesthetic practice which does not require neuromuscular blockage, is suitable for these patients. Copyright © 2013 Sociedade Brasileira de Anestesiologia.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neuroimmunological disorder characterized by severe progressive muscle stiffness in axial and lower extremity musculature with superimposed painful muscle spasms. Although chest pain is a common reason for SPS patients presenting to the emergency room, this disorder is overlooked and not part of the differential diagnosis of chest pain. Herein, we report on a middle age male presenting with classic symptoms of SPS; however, due to the rarity of this disease, he was initially thought to have acute coronary syndrome. Clinicians should consider the diagnosis of SPS in patients with fluctuating muscle spasms in the torso and/or extremities in the setting of repeated hospitalizations without subsequent symptom relief.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stiff person syndrome is a highly disabling, progressive autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system characterized by muscle rigidity and spasms. Stiff person syndrome is rare, but is believed to be under diagnosed with only 14 cases been reported among a 1.7 billion population in South Asia. We report the first authenticated case from Sri Lanka., CASE PRESENTATION: A 55-year-old Sri Lankan female presented with difficulty in walking and recurrent falls due to progressive muscular rigidity in her lower limbs and trunk with superimposed muscle spasms that occurred in response to unexpected noise, startle or emotional upset. She had anxiety and specific phobias to open spaces, walking unaided and being among crowds of people. She had insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and was on thyroxine replacement. On examination, she had hyperlordosis combined with board-like rigidity of her anterior abdomen and rigidity of her lower limbs bilaterally. Upper limbs were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging of her neuraxis was normal. Electromyography showed continuous motor unit activity at rest. Glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies were detected in her serum at a titre of 15,500 IU/ml (normal <5). She showed a remarkable and sustained improvement to treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins, immunosuppressive and muscle relaxant medications, regaining independent ambulation., CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of stiff person syndrome remains clinical, supported by electromyography and serology for glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, facilitated by a high index of clinical suspicion. An autoimmune basis lends stiff person syndrome amenable to treatment highlighting the importance of diagnosis. This case adds to map the worldwide distribution of stiff person syndrome.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Stiff person syndrome is a neurologic disorder characterized by axial rigidity leading to progressive disability, with broad clinical spectrum., METHODS: We report 2 cases with unique clinical presentation., RESULTS: Two young men suffered progressive urinary retention requiring bladder catheterization, anorectal spasms and constipation, complicated subsequently with lower extremity trigger-induced spasms, and gait instability. Associated symptoms revealed brainstem involvement (vertigo, diplopia, and cranial neuropathies) and dysautonomia (abnormal sweating and orthostatic hypotension). Anal manometry demonstrated incomplete relaxation of the anal sphincter. The first case was associated with diabetes mellitus type I, did not respond to classical therapies, but was responsive to rituximab. The second case responded to intravenous immunoglobulin infusions. Paraneoplastic profiles were negative, and anti-GAD65 antibody titers remained elevated despite successful therapeutic responses., CONCLUSIONS: We want to raise awareness that stiff person syndrome can present with esophageal, anorectal, and urethral sphincter disturbance. Rituximab is a good therapeutic option in intractable cases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare disorder characterized by muscular rigidity and stiffness., CASE PRESENTATIONS: We describe an SPS patient presenting with longstanding fatigue and electrophysiological evidence of presynaptic neuromuscular transmission defect, who responded to administration of pyridostigmine. In contrast, no electrophysiolgical evidence of neuromuscular transmission defect was demonstrated in 2 other SPS patients without fatigue symptoms., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies may play a role in presynaptic neuromuscular transmission defect of SPS patients with fatigue.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neuroimmunological disorder presenting with a wide variety of signs and symptoms that mimic neuro-inflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), thus delaying diagnosis., METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of over 100 patients with SPS who were treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital and identified five patients previously diagnosed with MS., RESULTS: Patients were female with a mean age of 53years old (range 43-64). Mean time to SPS diagnosis was 5.5years. They presented with typical SPS features (axial/leg spasms, torso rigidity, hyperlordosis, and gait instability) as well as atypical features (hemiparesis, hemisensory dysfunction, fine motor impairment) and were all initially given a diagnosis of MS. In all patients, brain MRI demonstrated non-specific white matter lesions and CSF was negative for intrathecal antibodies in the 4 out of 5 patients who underwent lumbar puncture. SPS diagnosis was supported by elevated anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) antibodies in each patient. Two patients were treated with disease-modifying therapies for MS before being diagnosed with SPS. Following diagnosis with SPS, the patients were treated with varying combinations of immunosuppressants and symptomatic therapies resulting in stabilization or improvement in four of the patients., CONCLUSION: We present five patients with SPS, who were initially thought to have MS, including one patient treated with three different MS therapies due to "disease progression". These cases demonstrate the need to consider less common neuroimmunological disorders, such as SPS, especially in patients with atypical features for MS. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Methods: This retrospective and descriptive study evaluated the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with CA-GAD-ab., Result: Three patients with cerebellar ataxia, high GAD-ab titers and autoimmune endocrine disease were identified. Patients 1 and 2 had classic stiff person syndrome and insidious-onset cerebellar ataxia, while Patient 3 had pure cerebellar ataxia with subacute onset. Patients received intravenous immunoglobulin therapy with no response in Patients 1 and 3 and partial recovery in Patient 2., Conclusion: CA-GAD-ab is rare and its clinical presentation may hamper diagnosis. Clinicians should be able to recognize this potentially treatable autoimmune cerebellar ataxia.

AB  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors are a novel group of immunotherapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer. Immune-related adverse events, including neurological symptoms, have been associated with these agents. We present the case of an adolescent with refractory Hodgkin lymphoma treated with nivolumab, a PD1 inhibitor, who developed Hashimoto thyroiditis, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome causing seizures, as well as urinary retention, truncal/appendicular spasticity, dysphagia, and a progressive encephalopathy that was clinically consistent with a diagnosis of progressive encephalopathy with rigidity and myoclonus, a stiff-person-syndrome spectrum disorder. He showed response and ultimately full recovery to a combination of intravenous steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and plasma exchange. To our knowledge, this is the first documented report of an immune-related neurological reaction to nivolumab in an adolescent patient and expands the spectrum of known nivolumab-associated toxicities.

AB  - We report a case of a 72-year-old woman who initially presented with symptoms of bulbar myasthenia and was positive for anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies. She subsequently developed painful muscle spasms, myoclonus, and stiffness. Thymoma was detected, and both anti-glycine receptor and anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies were found. She was diagnosed with thymoma-associated progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM). She experienced marked improvement after thymectomy followed by plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin and prednisolone. This case suggests that thymectomy followed by sufficient immunosuppression may be useful in the treatment of thymoma-associated PERM. Myasthenia gravis may develop in thymoma-associated PERM patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In stiff person syndrome (SPS), an antibody-mediated impaired gamma-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) neurotransmission is believed to cause muscle stiffness and spasms. Most patients improve with GABA-enhancing drugs and intravenous immunoglobulin, but some respond poorly and remain disabled. The need for more effective therapy prompted a trial with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab., METHODS: This was a placebo-controlled randomized trial of rituximab (2 biweekly infusions of 1g each). The primary outcome was a change in stiffness scores at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were changes in heightened-sensitivity and quality of life scores. Enrolling 24 patients was calculated to detect 50% change in stiffness scores., RESULTS: Randomization was balanced for age, sex, disease duration, and glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody titers. No significant changes were noted at 6 months after treatment in all outcomes. Specifically, no differences were noted in the stiffness index, the primary outcome, or sensitivity scores, the secondary outcome, at 3 or 6 months. Quality of life scores improved significantly (p < 0.01) at 3 months in both groups, but not at 6 months, denoting an early placebo effect. Blinded self-assessment rating of the overall stiffness for individual patients revealed improvement in 4 patients in each group. At 6 months, improvement persisted in 1 patient in the placebo group versus 3 of 4 in the rituximab group, where these meaningful improvements were also captured by video recordings., INTERPRETATION: This is the largest controlled trial conducted in SPS patients and demonstrates no statistically significant difference in the efficacy measures between rituximab and placebo. Rituximab's lack of efficacy could be due to a considerable placebo effect; insensitivity of scales to quantify stiffness, especially in the less severely affected patients; or drug effectiveness in only a small patient subset.

AB  - The aim of this study is to compare the rates of clinically relevant and clinically irrelevant neuronal autoantibodies among patients presenting with new neurological symptoms. We reviewed 401 neurological patients who were tested for the Mayo-Clinic paraneoplastic panel from January 2014 to December 2014 at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. We divided antibody-positive patients into two groups: clinically relevant (CR), in which a recognizable autoimmune or paraneoplastic syndrome was confirmed, and clinically irrelevant (CI), in which an autoimmune/paraneoplastic etiology was initially suspected but an alternative diagnosis was eventually found. We used Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables to identify differences between the two groups. Fifty-three patients tested positive for one or more neuronal autoantibodies. There were 17 CR (65% females, mean age 56 years), 33 CI, and 3 indeterminate patients. Compared to CI patients, CR patients were more likely to present with movement disorders or stiff person syndrome, have inflammatory CSF markers, cancer or smoking history, concomitant hyponatremia, and classical onconeuronal antibodies. CI patients were more likely to have a neuromuscular presentation, a chronic course, and antibodies against synaptic antigens. By combining the most robust differentiating factors, we developed a simple scale that predicted clinical relevance with an odds ratio of 50.3 (CI 8.2-309.9, P < 0.0001) if the score was >= 2. Up to 62% of neuronal autoantibody-positive patients are ultimately found to have an alternative diagnosis. Several clinical and laboratory factors can differentiate CR from CI patients to aid in interpretation of positive results.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome is a rare neuroimmunological disease, characterized by severe, involuntary stiffness with superimposed painful muscle spasms, which are worsened by external stimuli. The classical form is associated with high levels of antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase. One of the variant forms is associated with antibodies against amphiphysin. This entity is a paraneoplastic syndrome, caused primarily by breast cancer, secondarily by lung cancer. Symptomatic therapy of anti amphiphysin positive stiff person syndrome includes treatment with benzodiazepines and baclofen (including intrathecal baclofen therapy). The effect of immunological therapies is controversial. Treatment of the underlying cancer may be very effective. In this report, we describe a 68 year old female presenting with an unusally rapidly developing anti amphiphysin positive stiff person syndrome, which was associated with breast cancer. Her painful spasms abolished after intrathecal baclofen treatment was initiated. Her condition improved spontaneously and significantly after cancer treatment, which enabled to start her complex rehabilitation and the simultaneous dose reduction of the intrathecal baclofen. The bedridden patient improved to using a rollator walker and the baclofen pump could be removed 18 monthes after breast surgery. This highlights the importance of cancer screening and treatment in anti amphiphysin positive stiff person syndrome cases.

AB  - PURPOSE: To report a rare case of filamentary keratitis associated with stiff person syndrome., METHODS: Case report., RESULTS: A 26-year-old woman with several autoimmune conditions was referred because of filamentary keratitis. Conservative management using lubrication, mucolytics, and bandage contact lenses failed to adequately relieve symptoms. Despite the addition of oral prednisone, cyclosporine, and azathioprine, the patient's condition persisted with numerous filaments and severe dry eye. One month later, the patient had an episode of sudden muscle cramps in her back, for which she was hospitalized. Investigations revealed a diagnosis of stiff person syndrome, positive for glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies. Plasmapheresis and high-dose intravenous steroids were provided as initial therapy. On follow-up, her filamentary keratitis resolved and at the last visit, her ocular symptoms had completely resolved., CONCLUSIONS: Filamentary keratitis is a chronic, recurrent condition that can be challenging to treat. Effective management requires careful consideration of possible predisposing causes, especially in refractory cases.

AB  - To determine clinical features of neurologic disorders associated with anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (anti-GAD-Ab), we examined titers and time-dependent changes of anti-GAD-Ab. Six patients, stiff person syndrome (2), cerebellar ataxia (1), limbic encephalitis (1), epilepsy (1), brainstem encephalitis (1), were compared with 87 type I diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients without neurologic disorders. Anti-GAD-Ab titers and index were higher in neurologic disorders than in T1DM, suggesting intrathecal antibody synthesis. Anti-GAD-Ab titers in T1DM decreased over time, whereas they remained high in neurologic disorders. Immunotherapy improved neurological disorders and anti-GAD-Ab titers and index provide clinically meaningful information about their diagnostic accuracy. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is associated with axial rigidity superimposed on sustained muscle spasms. These symptoms commonly interfere with the performance of activities of daily living including ambulation. This retrospective case series evaluates the outcomes of screening tests and chronic infusion of intrathecal baclofen (ITB) in patients diagnosed with SPS treated in our spasticity clinic., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were identified from an institutional review board-approved clinical registry of ITB therapy. Data from clinical encounters were extracted from the registry and from the patients' electronic medical record. All patients with medically refractory spasticity related to SPS screened with an ITB injection were included. In addition to pertinent demographic and clinical information, data from validated outcome measures routinely used in the clinic were collected: pain Numeric Rating Scale, Spasm Frequency Scale, lower extremity Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), and Timed 25 Foot Walk. Outcomes data for chronic ITB infusion were assessed at early (<6 months) and late follow-up (6-12 months) visits after surgery., RESULTS: Nine patients were included, and seven received chronic ITB infusion. MAS scores were improved at early and late follow-up, and five patients experienced a reduction in pain scores. Walking performance remained stable in previously ambulatory patients. Four patients experienced complications related to ITB implantation, which resolved with medical or surgical treatment., CONCLUSION: Consistent with other case series, our results suggest that ITB is an effective therapy for medically intractable spasticity due to SPS, and symptom reduction can be achieved without compromising ambulation.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neuroimmunological disorder characterized by progressive muscular rigidity and spasms that affect axial and limb muscles. There have been a few reports that patients with SPS had evidences of polymyositis. There have been no clear explanations about the characteristics of polymyositis in SPS. We report the case of a 36-year-old woman with SPS in association with nonspecific focal myositis secondary to sustained muscle contraction. She presented with stiffness and pain in her extremities, and diazepam and baclofen were ineffective. With immunotherapy, her serum creatinine kinase levels reduced; however, her clinical symptoms progressively worsened. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: V.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To address practical issues in measuring autoantibodies to neuronal cell-surface antigens (NSAs) in various autoimmune neurological disorders (ANDs)., METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical information of 221 patients with clinically suspected ANDs who underwent antibody testing for NSAs between January 2007 and September 2017. 31 were excluded. In 190 patients, antibody-detection rate (ADR) and antibody-phenotype association were assessed., RESULTS: Fifty-four patients had NSA-antibodies: NMDA receptor (NMDAR) (n=39), AMPA receptor (n=3), leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1) (n=3), glycine receptor (GlyR) (n=3), GABA(A) receptor (n=2), GABA(B) receptor (n=1), metabotrophic glutamate receptor 5 (n=1), or unknown (n=6); 3 had multiple NSA-antibodies. ADR in patients with diagnostic criteria for "possible autoimmune encephalitis (AE)", "probable anti-NMDAR encephalitis", "definite autoimmune limbic encephalitis (ALE)", and "stiff-person spectrum disorder (SPSD)", was 34% (46/134), 85% (34/40), 46% (11/24), and 22% (4/18), respectively, but NSA-antibodies were not identified in 11 patients with systemic autoimmune disorders (SADs). Among 134 patients with "possible AE" criteria, NMDAR-antibodies were more frequently identified in patients with typical anti-NMDAR encephalitis than those without (34/40 [85%] vs. 4/94 [4%], p<0.0001). LGI1-antibodies were identified in patients with ALE but not in the others (3/24 [13%] vs. 0/110 [0%], p=0.005). GlyR-antibodies were identified in those with stiff-person syndrome plus (2/8, 25%) or stiff-limb syndrome (1/6, 17%)., CONCLUSIONS: NSA-antibodies were most frequently identified in "probable anti-NMDAR encephalitis", followed by "definite ALE", "possible AE", and "SPSD", but not identified in SADs. NMDAR, LGI1 and GlyR were associated with clinical phenotype. Cell-surface antigens should be determined based on individual phenotype. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Antibodies to glycine receptors (GlyR-Abs) were first defined in progressive encephalopathy with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) but were subsequently identified in other clinical presentations. Our aim was to assess the clinical associations of all patients identified with GlyR-Abs in Queensland, Australia, between April 2014 and May 2017 and to compare these to cases reported in the literature., METHODS: A literature review identified the clinical features of all published GlyR-Ab-positive cases through online databases. A case series was undertaken via collection of clinical information from all patients diagnosed or known to immunology, pathology or neurological services in Queensland during the study period of 3 years., RESULTS: In all, 187 GlyR-Ab-positive cases were identified in the literature. The majority (47.6%) had PERM, 22.4% had epilepsy, but the remaining 30% included mixed phenotypes consisting of cerebellar ataxia, movement disorders, demyelination and encephalitis/cognitive dysfunction. By contrast, in our series of 14 cases, eight had clinical presentations consistent with seizures and epilepsy and only three cases had classical features of PERM. There was one case each of global fatiguable weakness with sustained clonus, laryngeal dystonia and movement disorder with hemiballismus and tics. The rate of response to immune therapy was similar in all groups., CONCLUSION: Antibodies to glycine receptors are linked to a spectrum of neurological disease. The results of the literature review and our case series suggest a greater relationship between GlyR-Abs and epilepsy than previously reported. Copyright © 2018 EAN.

AB  - We herein report the case of stiff-person syndrome in a 73-year-old woman. She experienced episodes of painful muscle spasms and was admitted to another hospital. She was diagnosed with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. She showed improvement in muscle spasms post-chemotherapy, which was discontinued due to pancytopenia. Six months later, she was admitted to our hospital for repeated whole-body muscle spasms, at which point she was diagnosed with stiff-person syndrome. An anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody text was negative. Her muscle spasms disappeared after the administration of corticosteroids and rituximab. Stiff-person syndrome may develop with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. In the present case, corticosteroids and rituximab provided effective treatment.

AB  - Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) is an autoimmune disorder involving the brainstem and spinal cord and is sometimes associated with thymoma. We encountered a 75-year-old woman with typical PERM features, glycine receptor antibody, and thymoma. Her neurologic symptoms improved after thymectomy, but she unexpectedly developed anasarca with massive pleural effusions and hypoalbuminemia and finally succumbed to death. The autopsy showed edema and mononuclear infiltration in the pleura but no neuropathological findings typical of PERM. Effective treatment of PERM can reverse the neuropathological signs of encephalomyelitis. The autoimmune nature of anasarca is possible but not proven.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is an autoimmune disorder with multiple clinical presentations, all characterized by generalized or focal muscular stiffness leading to abnormal postures and movements. To date, no standardized treatments are available; also, the outcome measures are mainly clinical based and unstandardized, limiting the reliability of clinical trials. In this case study, we used the eight-camera motion capture system for gait analysis (GA) to outline the gait features and track the clinical evolution of a young patient with SPS receiving a personalized multimodal therapy. GA was accurate in reflecting clinical changes over a 7-week-long period, thus representing a potential source for objective biomarkers in SPS. Therefore, future studies focusing on either the natural history or the treatment of SPS could adopt GA for reliable outocome measures, confirming this preliminary observation.

AB  - We reported a Stiff person syndrome (SPS) patient with elevated autoantibodies against cardiolipin and beta2 glycoprotein 1 but without glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies. A 40-year male was admitted due to limited mouth opening for 1 week. His blood routine, biochemical, infectious diseases, tumor markers, radiographic examinations were all normal. At day 3 (D3) after admission, he developed paroxysmal systemic muscle rigidity. At D6, the on-duty physician occasionally gave oral clonazepam, which effectively relieved the symptom. At D13, the titers of cardiolipin and beta2 glycoprotein 1 autoantibodies elevated but the remaining autoantibodies were all in normal ranges. After clonazepam treatment for 1 week, the symptoms were basically relieved, and the titers of these two antibodies returned to normal range with the relief of symptoms. During the 3 years of follow-up, the symptoms did not present again, and the titers of both antibodies were stable in the normal ranges. He had no tumor and other immune system diseases. In summary, we reported a SPS case with elevated cardiolipin and beta2 glycoprotein 1 autoantibodies. The patient was highly responsive to clonazepam therapy, and had favorable outcome in the 3 years follow-up. Our report is helpful for better understand the heterogeneous feature of SPS.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a neurological disorder characterized by muscle rigidity primarily in the truncal muscles, commonly associated with autoantibodies to the glutamic acid-decarboxylase 65 kD receptor (GAD65). There is limited epidemiological information on patients with SPS., METHODS: We performed a retrospective case review using the National United States Veterans Affairs Health Administration electronic medical record system. We analyzed prevalence, demographics, disease characteristics, and treatment outcomes in SPS patients who were anti-GAD65 antibody positive., RESULTS: Fifteen patients met our criteria. Point prevalence was 2.06 per million, and period prevalence was 2.71 per million. Men to women ratio was 14:1. All patients benefitted from treatment with symptomatic antispasmodic agents. Ten of 15 patients received intravenous immunoglobulin, with a majority demonstrating stable or improved modified Rankin scores., DISCUSSION: This investigation was a large North American epidemiological study of SPS with predominantly male patients. Symptomatic therapy was beneficial for most patients, with less clear sustained benefit of immunotherapy. Muscle Nerve 58:801-804, 2018. Copyright © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) syndrome is a rare neurological condition. Its clinical characteristics include axial and limb muscle rigidity, myoclonus, painful spasms and hyperekplexia. Diagnosis of this disease can be very challenging and optimal long-term treatment is unclear., CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 62 year old patient admitted for repetitive myoclonus and rigidity in the lower limbs progressing since 10 years, associated with a fluctuating encephalopathy requiring stays in Intensive Care Unit. Multiple diagnostics and treatment were proposed, unsuccessfully, before the diagnosis of PERM syndrome was established. In association with the clinical presentation, a strong positive result for GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase) antibodies lead to the diagnosis of PERM syndrome., CONCLUSIONS: PERM syndrome is a rare disease and its diagnosis is not easy. Once the diagnosis is established, the correct treatment should follow and could be lifesaving, regardless of a delayed diagnosis. Maintenance of long-term oral corticotherapy is suggested to prevent relapses.

AB  - We herein describe the successful anesthetic management of a patient with stiff person syndrome undergoing right total hip replacement under spinal anesthesia. We also describe the problems associated with general anesthesia. The advantage of using regional anesthesia in these patients is the avoidance of muscle relaxants. The use of general anesthesia carries the risk of hypotonia in stiff person syndrome postoperatively due to enhancement of &gamma; aminobutyric acid (GABA) action on synaptic transmission by drugs that have a &gamma; GABA agonistic action.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) is an under-diagnosed disorder that affects mobility and the quality of life of affected patients. The aim of the study is to describe the natural history of SPS, the extent of accumulated disability and the associated clinical and immunological features in patients followed for up to 8 years in a single center., METHODS: Our collective cohort included 57 SPS patients. Additionally, 32 of these patients were examined every 6 months for a two-year period in a longitudinal study protocol, to assess disease progression using quantitative measures of stiffness and heightened sensitivity., RESULTS: The most frequent initial symptom was leg stiffness, followed by paraspinal muscle rigidity and painful spasms in 95% of the patients. Although none of the patients required assistance for ambulation during the first 2 years of disease onset, 46 patients (80%) lost the ability to walk independently during our follow-up, despite symptomatic medications. In the longitudinal cohort, the number of stiff areas increased (p < 0.0001), consistent with worsening functional status and quality of life. High-titer anti-GAD antibodies were present in serum and CSF with elevated intrathecal GAD-specific IgG synthesis, but they did not correlate with clinical severity or progression., CONCLUSIONS: This large study on SPS patients, combining an eight-year follow-up at a single center by the same leading neurologist and his team, is the first to provide longitudinal data in a large patient subgroup using objective clinical measures. One of the main findings is that SPS is a progressive disease leading to physical disability over time.

Its diagnosis has always been challenging due to the lack of a specific confirmation test. We present a rare case of a patient with lower limb myoclonus and rigidity., PATIENT CONCERNS: A 53-year-old male presented with a sudden onset of progressive left lower extremity myoclonus and muscle rigidity for 3 days. He rapidly showed signs of right lower limb involvement with severe joint stiffness and inability to walk., DIAGNOSIS: The symptoms nature, physical examination, careful elimination of differential diagnosis suggested a diagnosis of stiff limb syndrome., INTERVENTIONS: Intravenous infusion of gamma globulin 0.4 mg/kg coupled with baclofen and clonazepam were given after admission. He also received an injection of botulinum toxin A to relieve his muscle stiffness., OUTCOMES: The patients' condition improved after the initial treatment with complete disappearance of muscle twitching. Further improvements were seen later on after the local administration of botulinum toxin A., LESSONS: Stiff limb syndrome shares the same complex symptoms with many other conditions. Its diagnosis relies heavily on clinical presentations and on ruling out other conditions. However, unusual symptoms such as myoclonus can occur in few cases and together with the rarity of the condition, the prevalence of misdiagnosis is high. Therefore, being aware and recognizing the signs and symptoms is crucial for proper management. Additionally, EMG is a very important test if the present condition is suspected. However, a negative EMG result or a negative anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody test should not exclude SLS diagnosis.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome was diagnosed in a patient with chronic low back pain. The diagnosis of this rare neurological condition rests mainly on the clinical findings of axial and proximal limb rigidity, increased lumbar lordosis often accompanied with pain, and normal neurological findings apart from brisk deep tendon reflexes. Electromyography of the lumbar paraspinal muscles shows motor unit firing at rest with normal appearance of the motor unit potentials. Titers of antibody to glutamic acid decarboxylase are elevated. Diazepam is the treatment of reference. Physical therapy can substantially improve quality of life.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) and anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis are rare paraneoplastic syndromes caused by antibodies that target the central nervous system. Here, we describe a 26-year-old woman who presented with psychosis, amnesia, rigidity and fever. After extensive diagnostic and laboratory workup, she was diagnosed with an ovarian teratoma which was causing the symptoms of anti-NMDAR encephalitis and SPS. The patient was successfully treated with laparoscopic removal of the ovarian tumour under general anaesthesia. She was placed on immunosuppressant medications preoperatively and postoperatively, and her symptoms gradually resolved. Although there are case reports regarding the anaesthetic management of SPS and anti-NMDAR encephalitis, our study is the first report of a patient afflicted with both conditions.

AB  - An autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system, stiff person syndrome, frequently presents with increased titers of 65KD anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD) antibodies. The clinical phenomenology of this syndrome includes stiffness, ataxia, vertigo due to horizontal gaze-evoked and downbeat vertical nystagmus, and dysmetria of saccades and reaching movements. Here, we describe a novel phenomenology of syndrome of anti-GAD antibody, non-position-dependent upbeat nystagmus and superimposed horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus. Lack of gravity dependence of primary position upbeat nystagmus, intense nystagmus on up-gaze, relatively stable gaze on downward orientation, and the exponentially decaying waveform suggests neural integrator dysfunction. The titer of anti-GAD in our patient (30 U/ml) was consistent with a variant called "low-titer anti-GAD syndrome". In addition of presenting as an unusual manifestation of a rare neurological syndrome, this case presents a neurochemical correlate of upbeat nystagmus in GABA-mediated control system involving horizontal and vertical neural integrators. Furthermore, the variant of "low-titer anti-GAD syndrome" suggests that GABAergic system may be affected at lower level or antibodies, and/or the epitopes of antibody in those with full-blown clinical syndrome, but low titers of anti-GAD may be different.

AB  - A number of cortical and spinal excitability variables have been tested in a patient with Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS), before and after immunotherapy with mycophenolate mofetil, intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroids, which normalized plasma levels of anti-GAD antibodies and dramatically improved the clinical picture. The overlapping time-course of neurophysiological, clinical and bio-umoral findings suggests that immunotherapy might have changed GABA/Glutamate balance at cortical level, favoring the former, as reflected by normalization of the startle reflex, lengthening of the cortical silent period and clear-cut reduction of intracortical facilitation to paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation. This represents the first report investigating effects of immunotherapy on cortical excitability in SPS.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is an autoimmune neurological disorder characterized by stiffness of the skeletal muscle with superimposed spasms and production of autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and amphiphysin. The disorder results from B cell-mediated clonal production of autoantibodies, requiring treatment with immunosuppressors; however, treatment results have been somewhat inconsistent. We report the results of rituximab treatment in a patient with SPS associated with a thymoma, diabetes mellitus, autoimmune thyroiditis and the presence of anti-GAD and anti-amphiphysin autoantibodies. The patient experienced a partial improvement following a thymectomy and the administration of prednisone, intravenous immunoglobulins and mycophenolate mofetil. Treatment with rituximab was followed by a complete sustained remission and the disappearance of serum anti-amphiphysin antibodies. Copyright 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS), a rare neuroimmunological disorder, is characterized by symmetrical rigidity and muscle stiffness, particularly of axial and proximal limb muscles. Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) is a variant of SPS which includes additional clinical features (e.g. sensory symptoms, brain stem signs and pathological CSF findings). An association of both SPS and PERM with (solid) malignancies has been previously reported. Beyond this, there have been single reports of SPS in the setting of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). Here, we present a case of PERM associated with HL, with PERM preceding occurrence of lymphoma by more than seven months. Our observation has obvious implications for the management and, in particular, diagnostic evaluation of patients with PERM. Copyright 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We report a patient with stiff-person syndrome and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody, who suddenly complained of diplopia due to dysthyroid ophthalmopathy. Therapeutic efficacy of plasmapheresis and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin was transient. After starting administration of rituximab, the patient showed obvious improvement of muscle spasms due to stiff-person syndrome and ophthalmoplegia following quick depletion of CD20-positive cells in peripheral blood. The anti-GAD and anti-thyroid antibodies decreased slowly. This drug might be a potent therapeutic option for refractory patients with stiff-person syndrome, particularly in those associated with dysthyroid ophthalmopathy.

AB  - Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) is a rare disease. PERM consists of the same symptoms as stiff person syndrome, in addition to sensory, brainstem and autonomic features. We herein report a case of PERM in a 48-year-old woman who initially presented with spasticity of the lower limbs and subsequently developed upper limb spasticity, perioral myoclonus and restlessness after three months. The onset of potentially fatal dysautonomia was observed at the peak of the disease. Treatment with high-dose immunoglobulin (400 mg/kg, 5 days), levetiracetam and azathioprine resulted in a drastic and sustained improvement of these symptoms. This is an interesting case of PERM in which the patient showed a dramatic improvement following immune moderation.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare and disabling central nervous system disorder first described in 1956 and characterized by fluctuating rigidity and stiffness, gait impairment, and painful spasms of the axial and limb musculature. Although an underlying mechanism of impaired synaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic inhibition has been proposed, the exact mechanism remains unclear. The glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody, a marker for SPS, is a strong indication of disease and has been reported in approximately 70% of patients. The current treatment of choice is benzodiazepines and baclofen, both of which reduce motor unit potential firing and, therefore, decrease stiffness and spasms. However, patients continue to have substantial disability with pharmacologic therapy alone. This case report demonstrates the potential of osteopathic manipulative treatment as an adjunct to medication in the management of SPS. By decreasing somatic dysfunction and reducing the frequency of exacerbations, osteopathic manipulative treatment may alleviate the symptoms and overall morbidity associated with this disease.

AU  - Zdziarski, Przemyslaw
PY  - 2015
PD  - /
AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune disease. Most patients have high-titer antibodies against glutamate decarboxylase (GADAb), which is without practical value in disease monitoring. Benzodiazepines are the first line drugs, but long-term use is not well characterized. This report demonstrates ineffective benzodiazepine therapy of SPS that prompts tachyphylaxis, loss of responsiveness, and finally benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Convulsion and anxiety correlate with high level of creatine phosphokinase (CK). Although tonus and spasm attacks were successfully controlled by tizanidine, glutamate release inhibitor, the immune response, and autoimmune diabetes development require the plasmapheresis, mycophenolat mofetil, and rituximab therapy that results in a significant decrease of GADAb, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and CK normalization. Unfortunately, reintroduction of benzodiazepine was a source of rapid and high increase of CK, LDH, GADAb titer (up to 1:15,000), IGT, and SPS relapse. Contrary to previous publications, we observed IGT that correlated with high anti-GAD level, but without high immunogenetic susceptibility to haplotype human leukocyte antigens-DR3, DQw2. This preliminary observation and the last finding of immunomodulatory properties of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor suggest that increased antigenic stimulation during benzodiazepine therapy and glutamatergic hyperactivity could account for convulsions observed in SPS. Benzodiazepine withdrawal prompted alternative muscle relaxant therapy (tizanidine). Muscular and brain abnormalities observed in SPS indicate that noncardiac CK level may be a useful tool in SPS therapy monitoring.

AB  - Glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) and autoantibodies specific for GAD65 (GADA) are associated with autoimmune diseases including Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) and Type 1 diabetes (T1D). GADA is recognized as a biomarker of value for clinical diagnosis and prognostication in these diseases. Nonetheless, it remains medically interesting to develop sensitive and specific assays to detect GAD65 preceding GADA emergence, and to monitor GADA-GAD65 immune complexes in blood samples. In the present study, we developed a highly sensitive proximity ligation assay to measure serum GAD65. This novel assay allowed detection of as little as 0.65 pg/ml GAD65. We were also able to detect immune complexes involving GAD65 and GADA. Both free GAD65 and GAD65-GADA levels were significantly higher in serum samples from SPS patients compared to healthy controls. The proximity ligation assays applied for detection of GAD65 and its immune complexes may thus enable improved diagnosis and better understanding of SPS.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Little is known of glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GAD-abs) in the paraneoplastic context. Clinical recognition of such cases will lead to prompt tumor diagnosis and appropriate treatment., OBJECTIVE: To report the clinical and immunological features of patients with paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS) and GAD-abs., DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective case series study and immunological investigations conducted in February 2014 in a center for autoimmune neurological disorders. Fifteen cases with GAD65-abs evaluated between 1995 and 2013 who fulfilled criteria of definite or possible PNS without concomitant onconeural antibodies were included in this study., MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Analysis of the clinical records of 15 patients and review of 19 previously reported cases. Indirect immunofluorescence with rat hippocampal neuronal cultures and cell-based assays with known neuronal cell-surface antigens were used. One hundred six patients with GAD65-abs and no cancer served as control individuals., RESULTS: Eight of the 15 patients with cancer presented as classic paraneoplastic syndromes (5 limbic encephalitis, 1 paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis, 1 paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, and 1 opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome). When compared with the 106 non-PNS cases, those with PNS were older (median age, 60 years vs 48 years; P = .03), more frequently male (60% vs 13%; P < .001), and had more often coexisting neuronal cell-surface antibodies, mainly against gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors (53% vs 11%; P < .001). The tumors more frequently involved were lung (n = 6) and thymic neoplasms (n = 4). The risk for an underlying tumor was higher if the presentation was a classic PNS, if it was different from stiff-person syndrome or cerebellar ataxia (odds ratio, 10.5; 95% CI, 3.2-34.5), or if the patient had coexisting neuronal cell-surface antibodies (odds ratio, 6.8; 95% CI, 1.1-40.5). Compared with the current series, the 19 previously reported cases had more frequent stiff-person syndrome (74% vs 13%; P = .001) and better responses to treatment (79% vs 27%; P = .005). Predictors of improvement in the 34 patients (current and previously reported) included presentation with stiff-person syndrome and the presence of a thymic tumor., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Patients with GAD-abs must be screened for an underlying cancer if they have clinical presentations different from those typically associated with this autoimmunity or develop classic PNS. The risk for cancer increases with age, male sex, and the presence of coexisting neuronal cell-surface antibodies.

AB  - Chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction (CIP) can be a severe burden and even a life-threatening disorder. Typically, several years of uncertainty are passing before diagnosis. We are reporting the case of a young woman with a decade of severe, progressive gastrointestinal dysmotility. Unusually, she had also developed an autonomic neuropathy, and a stiff limb syndrome. In addition to achalasia and CIP the young woman also developed neuropathic symptoms: orthostatic intolerance, urinary retention, a Horner syndrome, and lower limb stiffness. Careful interdisciplinary diagnostics excluded underlying infectious, rheumatoid, metabolic or tumorous diseases. The detection of GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase) antibodies, however, seemed to link CIP, autonomic neuropathy, and limb stiffness and pointed at an autoimmune origin of our patient's complaints. This was supported by the positive effects of intravenous immunoglobulin. In response to this therapy the body weight had stabilized, orthostatic tolerance had improved, and limb stiffness was reversed. The case suggested that GAD antibodies should be considered in CIP also in nondiabetic patients. This may support earlier diagnosis and immunotherapy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Stiff person syndrome is a rare autoimmune, neurological disorder characterized by progressive rigidity and episodic painful spasms, predominantly affecting the proximal limbs and axial muscles, and leading to progressive disability. We report the case of a child who developed symptoms compatible with stiff person syndrome during treatment for pleuropulmonary blastoma., PATIENT DESCRIPTION: A 3-year, 5-month-old girl was admitted for gradually worsening postural tremor, painful spasms, and generalized stiffness. Since the age of 3 years, she had been on adjuvant chemotherapy for pleuropulmonary blastoma before surgical resection. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalographic findings were normal. Although serologic tests for autoimmune disease, including paraneoplastic antibodies and antiglutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, were unremarkable, her findings were attributed to a paraneoplastic syndrome based on her clinical features and medical history. However, following the planned pulmonary lobectomy, her symptoms were paradoxically aggravated, with continuous motor unit potential at rest on electromyography, which occurs in stiff person syndrome. She gradually improved during postadjuvant chemotherapy with simultaneous immunotherapy including intravenous immunoglobulins and methylprednisolone, and she had recovered completely when evaluated at the 22-month follow-up visit after completion of her treatment for pleuropulmonary blastoma., CONCLUSION: We present the first documented child with stiff person syndrome associated with pleuropulmonary blastoma. The marked clinical improvement following chemotherapy for pleuropulmonary blastoma was yet more proof of the pleuropulmonary blastoma-related stiff person syndrome. In children with a malignancy and stiff person syndrome, a paraneoplastic syndrome should be considered and the treatment for the malignancy must be undertaken. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune neurological disorder characterized by progressive stiffness and rigidity of truncal muscles accompanied with co-contraction of agonist-antagonist muscles. Our 51-year-old female patient was presented for the first time to physiatrists in 2006 and diagnosed with axial-spondyloarthropathy (SpA) HLA-B27 positive. SPS was diagnosed 7 years after initial symptoms. SPS should be taken into consideration in HLA-B27 positive patients if stiffness of paravertebral and abdominal muscles progresses during SpA therapy.

AB  - Autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (Gad-Abs) are implicated in various neurological syndromes. The present study aims to identify intrathecal-specific GAD-Abs and to determine clinical manifestations and treatment outcomes. Nineteen patients had GAD-Abs in cerebrospinal fluid but not in paired serum samples. Neurological syndromes included limbic encephalitis, temporal lobe epilepsy, cerebellar ataxia, autonomic dysfunction, and stiff-person syndrome. Immunotherapy had beneficial effects in 57.1% of patients, and the patients with limbic encephalitis responded especially well to immunotherapy. Intrathecal-specific antibodies to GAD at low titers may appear as nonspecific markers of immune activation within the central nervous system rather than pathogenic antibodies causing neuronal dysfunction.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Symptoms of stiff-person syndrome (SPS), stiff-limb syndrome (SLS), or progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity, myoclonus, or other symptoms (SPS-plus) can occur with several autoantibodies, but the relative frequency of each antibody, syndrome specificity, and prognostic implications are unclear., OBJECTIVE: To report the clinical and immunologic findings of a large cohort of patients with stiff-person spectrum disorder (SPSD), including SPS, SLS, and SPS-plus., DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: This study retrospectively examined a case series (January 1, 1998, through December 31, 2014) of immunologic investigations performed in a neuroimmunology referral center. The study included 121 patients with clinical features of SPSD. Data analysis was performed from July 1, 2015, through November 1, 2015., MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Analysis of clinical-immunologic associations, including autoantibodies to 8 proteins expressed in inhibitory synapses., RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 51 years (interquartile range, 40-61 years), and 75 (62.0%) were female. Fifty (41.3%) had SPS, 37 (30.6%) had SPS-plus, 24 (19.8%) had SLS, and 10 (8.3%) had SPS or SLS overlapping with ataxia, epilepsy, or encephalitis. Fifty-two patients (43.0%) had glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) antibodies (2 with gamma-aminobutyric acid-A [GABA-A] receptor antibodies), 24 (19.8%) had alpha1-subunit of the glycine receptor (GlyR) antibodies (2 with GAD65 antibodies), 5 (4.1%) had other antibodies, and 40 (33.1%) tested negative for antibodies. None had gephyrin or glycine transporter antibodies. Among the main immunologic groups (GAD65 antibodies, GlyR antibodies, and antibody negative), those with GAD65 antibodies were more likely to be female (45 [86.5%] of 52, 8 [36.4%] of 22, and 18 [45.0%] of 40, respectively; P < .001), have systemic autoimmunity (34 [65.4%] of 52, 7 [31.8%] of 22, and 13 [32.5%] of 40, respectively; P = .004), and have longer delays in being tested for antibodies (median, 3 vs 0.5 and 1 year; P < .001). Patients with GAD65 antibodies were more likely to develop SPS (27 [51.9%] of 52) or overlapping syndromes (8 [15.4%] of 52) than patients with GlyR antibodies (5 [22.7%] and 0 [0%] of 22, respectively), who more often developed SPS-plus (12 [54.5%] of 22 vs 7 [13.5%] in those with GAD65 antibodies); antibody-negative patients had an intermediate syndrome distribution. In multivariable analysis, symptom severity (P = .001) and immunologic group (P = .01) were independently associated with outcome. Compared with patients with GlyR antibodies, those with GAD65 antibodies (odds ratio, 11.1, 95% CI, 2.3-53.7; P = .003) had worse outcome. Patients without antibodies had similar outcome than patients with GlyR antibodies (odds ratio, 4.2, 95% CI, 0.9-20.0; P = .07)., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In SPSD, symptom severity and presence and type of antibodies are predictors of outcome.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome is a progressive disease of muscle rigidity and spasticity due to a deficiency in the production of gamma-aminobutyric acid. Because of the rarity of the condition, little is known about effects of anesthesia on patients with stiff-person syndrome. This report describes the clinical course for a single patient with stiff-person syndrome who received general anesthesia on 3 separate occasions. Her anesthetics included use of both neuromuscular blockade and volatile agents. Unlike several previous reports regarding anesthesia and stiff-person syndrome, the postoperative period for this patient did not require prolonged intubation or result in any residual weakness.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome is a rare neurologic disorder with an estimated incidence of 1:1000000. The underlying pathophysiology is truncal and proximal limb muscle stiffness resulting from continuous co-contracture of agonist and antagonist muscle groups concomitant with superimposed episodic muscle spasms. Loss of gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated inhibition creates chronic excitation manifested by tonic agonist-antagonist muscle contraction. To date, only three case reports referred indirectly to the anesthetic management of parturients with Stiff person syndrome. The authors describe their management of a parturient with Stiff person syndrome who underwent urgent cesarean delivery under epidural anesthesia. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare disorder characterized by progressive muscle stiffness, rigidity, and spasms involving the axial muscles. Acute respiratory distress has rarely been reported in this condition., METHODS: We report a case of a 49-year-old woman with autoimmune SPS diagnosed during an episode of acute respiratory failure secondary to repetitive episodes of apnea, requiring intensive care., RESULTS: Acute respiratory failure manifesting with apneic episodes is a life-threatening and unpredictable complication of SPS. Its pathophysiology is not well known. The two suggested mechanisms are as follows: (1) apnea due to muscle rigidity and paroxysmal muscle spasms, and (2) paroxysmal autonomic hyperactivity. Sudden and unexpected deaths have been reported in SPS, and all described cases have been associated with apnea. Thus, the onset of apnea during SPS should be considered a criterion of high severity and should lead to intensive care unit (ICU) admission for continuous monitoring. In patients with severe disease who are unresponsive to symptomatic treatment with benzodiazepines and baclofen, or in patients with life-threatening complications, early immunotherapy by intravenous immunoglobulins should be considered., CONCLUSION: Onset of apneas during SPS should be considered as a signal of possible progression toward acute respiratory failure and sudden death, and should lead to ICU admission for continuous monitoring. Early immunotherapy should be started in such situations, including intravenous immunoglobulins as the first-line treatment.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a neurologic disorder characterized by painful involuntary episodes of severe muscle rigidity affecting the axial muscles and extremities. Although the etiology of SPS is unknown, it is suspected to involve the synthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Symptoms of SPS are precipitated by sudden unexpected movements, noises, and stress. Additionally, SPS has been linked with various autoimmune disorders, including diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, pernicious anemia, and certain cancers. Because of the effect of SPS and SPS medications, inhalational agents and neuromuscular blockers have the potential to cause prolonged hypotonia following anesthesia, resulting in respiratory failure despite full reversal of neuromuscular blockade. In documented case reports, the outcomes of using general anesthesia with inhalational agents and neuromuscular blockers in patients with SPS varied. This case report highlights the anesthetic management of a 56-year-old woman with diagnosed SPS undergoing a hemicolectomy for a colon mass using total intravenous anesthesia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether structural and functional changes occur in the afferent visual system of patients with stiff-person syndrome (SPS) and whether these changes correlate with disease burden, given the high concentration of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors, which are generally thought to be involved in SPS pathogenesis, in the retina., METHODS: In this single-center, cross-sectional study, patients with SPS and healthy controls (HCs) underwent optical coherence tomography (OCT), with a subset undergoing high- and low-contrast visual acuity (VA) assessments. Burden of disease was assessed via the number of body regions affected. Individuals with uncontrolled hypertension or comorbid neurologic or ophthalmologic disorders were excluded. Statistical analyses were performed using mixed-effects linear regression models., RESULTS: Thirty-five patients with SPS and 40 age- and sex-matched HCs underwent OCT. A subset of 23 patients with SPS and 28 HCs underwent VA assessments. Relative to HCs, patients with SPS had lower ganglion cell + inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thicknesses (SPS: 74.36 microm [SD 5.7]; HCs: 76.33 microm [SD 4.2]; p = 0.005), inner nuclear layer thicknesses (SPS: 44.37 microm [SD 2.7]; HCs: 45.18 microm [SD 2.2]; p = 0.042), and 100% (SPS: 53 [SD 9.6]; HCs: 57.5 [SD 6.1]; p = 0.005), 2.5% (SPS: 24.35 [SD 10.1]; HCs: 30.16 [SD 7.7]; p = 0.006), and 1.25% contrast (SPS: 16.41 [SD 10.6]; HCs: 20.84 [SD 8.6]; p = 0.034) letter acuity scores. GCIPL thicknesses correlated with the number of body regions affected in SPS (decrease of 1.25 microm [95% confidence interval, -2.2 to -0.3 microm; p = 0.008] per additional body region affected)., CONCLUSIONS: Retinal neuronal pathology can occur in SPS. OCT may have utility as a biomarker of disease burden in SPS. Copyright © 2020 American Academy of Neurology.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is commonly associated with antibodies directed against 65-kDa glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65). Therapeutic Plasma Exchange (TPE) has been used as an adjunct therapy in patients who do not respond well to conventional treatment, which includes immunosuppression therapies, anti-anxiety medications, muscle relaxants, anticonvulsants, and pain relievers., METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data and outcomes of ten patients with the clinical diagnosis of anti-GAD65 positive SPS in which TPE was employed to improve symptoms refractory to conventional treatment during an eight-year period., RESULTS: TPE was initiated as complementary therapy in patients with worsening of symptoms characteristic of SPS. Six patients underwent chronic treatment with TPE following an initial course, of which the frequency of TPE was guided by the clinical response. Two patients only had transient improvements with further disease progression. Four patients developed a relapse of symptoms when the interval between procedures was increased. One of the four patients dependent on TPE had worsening of symptoms following complete cessation of TPE due to lack of insurance coverage. Four patients underwent only an acute hospitalized course of treatment with TPE; one demonstrated complete resolution of symptoms; one had a partial response; and two experienced no improvement., CONCLUSION: Our study supports previous reports that TPE may be beneficial for the management of patients with anti-GAD65 positive SPS, both for acute exacerbations and long-term maintenance, either as an adjunct therapy, or in lieu of treatment with disease modifying agents.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define the clinicopathologic features of amphiphysin-immunoglobulin G (IgG)-mediated neuropathy., METHODS: Patients examined at our institution from January 1, 1995, to September 30, 2018, with amphiphysin-IgG by indirect immunofluorescence and Western blot, were reviewed. Their phenotypes were compared to cases of coexisting collapsin response-mediator protein-5 (CRMP5)-IgG or anti-neuronal nuclear antibody type 1 (ANNA1-IgG) and CRMP5-IgG autoimmunity. Improvement in modified Rankin Scale (mRS) (>=1) on follow-up was considered a favorable outcome. Amphiphysin RNA expression was assessed in healthy nerves., RESULTS: Fifty-three amphiphysin-IgG-positive cases were identified. Of 33 (60%) patients with neuropathy, 21 had amphiphysin-IgG alone, and 12 had coexisting autoantibodies (ANNA1-IgG, n = 8; CRMP5-IgG, n = 2; ANNA1-IgG and CRMP5-IgG, n = 2). The neuropathies in isolated amphiphysin-IgG autoimmunity included polyradiculoneuropathy (62%), diffuse sensory neuronopathy (35%), and facial neuropathy with gastroparesis (3%). Among these, pain (80%), breast cancer (63%), and CNS (57%) involvements commonly coexisted, and neuropathy frequently prompted breast cancer diagnosis (76%). Stiff-person spectrum disorder was the most common CNS accompaniment (45%). Nerve biopsies showed axonal loss (n = 6/6), subperineurial edema (n = 4/6), and CD4 predominant inflammation (n = 2/6). Median mRS score at last follow-up was 3.5; 58% of patients were immunotherapy-responsive. Patients with amphiphysin-IgG alone had more favorable immunotherapy response than patients with CRMP5-IgG polyneuropathy (n = 45) (44% vs 16%, p = 0.028, odds ratio 4.2, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 15.5). Only 1/9 (11%) patients with amphiphysin-IgG with coexisting CRMP5-IgG or ANNA1-IgG had immunotherapy response. RNA amphiphysin expression occurred at low levels in nerve., CONCLUSION: Amphiphysin-IgG autoimmune neuropathy has a recognizable phenotype, is frequently immune responsive, and can prompt early diagnosis of breast cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune disorder that leads to progressively worsening stiffness and spasm of thoracic and proximal-limb musculature. Dyspnea has been reported but not analyzed in patients with SPS., MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this prospective study, 17 patients were recruited from a university-based neurology clinic. History and exam were performed, demographic information collected and available imaging reviewed. Dyspnea was assessed using vertical visual analog scales (VAS), the University of California San Diego Shortness of Breath Questionnaire (UCSD-SOBQ) and dyspnea "descriptors". Standardized assessments of SPS severity were performed by an experienced neurologist. Forced vital capacity (FVC) spirometric analysis was performed on all patients., RESULTS: Fifteen of 17 patients complained of dyspnea, including dyspnea at rest, with exertion, and disturbing sleep. A restrictive pattern was the most common abnormality noted on spirometry. FVC (r=-0.67; P < 0.01) and forced expiratory volume in 1-second (FEV1) (r=-0.76; P < 0.01) percent predicted correlated with dyspnea measured by VAS over the preceding 2 weeks. Pulmonary function did not correlate with UCSB-SOBQ or standardized measures of SPS severity., CONCLUSIONS: Dyspnea in SPS is common and occurs at rest with exertion and disturbs sleep. The finding of restrictive physiology and correlation between pulmonary function variables and dyspnea support the hypothesis that thoracic cage constriction by rigidity and/or spasm of the muscles of the trunk causes or contributes to the sensation of dyspnea. The possibility of diaphragmatic involvement requires further study. Copyright © 2019 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We present a case of a 65-year-old African American male, immunosuppressed on Tacrolimus, who initially presented with cerebellar ataxia and rapidly developed Progressive Encephalomyelitis with Rigidity and Myoclonus (PERM) with positive anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) antibodies, no underlying malignancy, and normal neuroimaging. PERM is a rare spectrum of Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS), which is strongly associated with anti-GAD antibodies and characterized by flare-ups and remissions of encephalopathy, myelopathy and rigidity with myoclonus. PERM is diagnosed clinically and has been successfully treated with both Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasmapheresis. Our patient was successfully treated with IVIg. On day 14 after starting IVIg treatment, his neurological symptoms started to improve and ultimately returned to baseline. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Motor unit hyperexcitability (MUH) may become manifest in needle electromyography (EMG) recordings as fasciculation potentials, myokymic discharges, or neuromyotonic discharges. Here, we describe a further MUH phenomenon., METHODS: Needle EMG recordings of the Neurology Hospital of Halle (Saale) stored in a video mode as .wav data between 2000 and 2015 were screened for spontaneous continuous motor unit single discharges (SCMUSD)., RESULTS: We identified 23 video needle EMG waveforms from 14 patients with SCMUSD. The corresponding motor units discharged at a rate of about 6 H Z (6.3 +/- 4.0; range, 1.3-18.1). The coefficient of variation of the discharge rate was 3.5% +/- 1.7%. Neurogenic disorders were diagnosed in 12 patients, limb girdle muscle dystrophy was diagnosed in one patient, and stiff-limb syndrome was diagnosed in one patient., DISCUSSION: Spontaneous continuous motor unit single discharge, as described here, widens the spectrum of MUH phenomena.

AB  - CASE: A 57-year-old man with a known case of stiff person syndrome (SPS) presented with an insidious-onset 3-month history of right groin pain and inability to bear weight on the right lower extremity. Radiographs demonstrated a displaced right neck of femur fracture. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging was negative for any infective or neoplastic pathology. Right primary cementless total hip replacement was performed. Significant improvement in function was noted after surgery., CONCLUSIONS: Femur neck fracture can result from severe muscle spasms and stiffness. Primary total hip replacement is a difficult but reasonable operative procedure for SPS with neck of femur fracture. The success of the procedure also depends on ideal medical control of muscle spasms and rigidity.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: High levels of autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-abs) are associated with stiff-person syndrome (SPS). However, the full clinical spectrum associated with GAD-abs in Asians is unclear. The clinical and immunological features of patients positive for GAD-abs were reviewed in a large Taiwanese series., METHODS: Retrospective case series and immunological investigations were conducted between July 2007 and July 2017 at a tertiary referral centre in Taiwan. Amongst 361 patients with GAD-ab reactivity, 185 with detailed clinical records were included., RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients (14.59%), with a mean age at assessment of 54.8 +/- 13.9 years, presented with neurological symptoms. The major neurological presentations (mean GAD-ab concentrations) were SPS (n = 9, 33.3%; 135.45 +/- 27.84 U/ml), cerebellar ataxia (n = 3, 11.1%; 95.61 +/- 49.63 U/ml), encephalopathy (n = 2, 7.4%; 51.8 +/- 49.64 U/ml) and epilepsy (n = 1, 3.7%; 83.3 U/ml). Notably, eight patients fulfilling the clinical diagnosis of multiple system atrophy had relatively lower GAD-ab concentrations (2.57 +/- 0.82 U/ml), which has not been reported previously. There was no correlation between disease severity and GAD-ab concentration. Patients presenting with comorbid endocrinopathies (n = 15, 55.5%) had higher GAD-ab concentrations than those without endocrinopathies (n = 12, 44.4%; 104.45 +/- 22.51 U/ml vs. 34.08 +/- 21.83 U/ml, P = 0.04). Of 158 patients (85.4%) without a neurological presentation, 133 had type 1 diabetes mellitus and 20 had diabetes of other aetiologies (type 2 or gestational diabetes mellitus, or diabetes secondary to pancreatitis); the remaining four patients had pure thyroid disorders., CONCLUSIONS: A clinical and immunological evaluation of East Asian patients positive for GAD-abs is presented and a different clinical spectrum of anti-GAD syndrome is identified compared to Caucasians.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare and challenging neuromuscular junction disorder with typical musculoskeletal manifestations associated with anti-GAD65 antibodies, extra rheumatological manifestations, including neuropsychiatric symptoms and severe dysautonomic troubles. Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) is also a rare condition corresponding to a sub-occlusive syndrome, resulting from the functional or structural impairment of smooth neuromuscular tissues of the intestinal tract. In the clinical spectrum of SPS, CIPO has rarely been described and dilated biliary tract has never been described. This present report is therefore the first in the context of anti-GAD65 antibodies with the additional involvement of the biliary tract. Here, we report the case of a 44-year-old woman hospitalized for a rapidly progressive CIPO associated with dilated biliary tract, revealing a typical SPS with slowly progressive rheumatologic complaints relegated to the background. The concomitant improvement of the neuromuscular function on skeletal, intestinal and biliary tree systems with the good outcomes of anti-GAD65 titer under immunosuppressant drugs, allowed us to link all three organic involvements to the antibody pathogenicity on the respective neuromuscular junctions. Therefore, we discussed their common pathogeny based on our patient's treatment outcome.

AB  - Stiff person spectrum disorders (SPSD) are a broad group of immune-mediated disorders. Clinical presentations include classical stiff person syndrome (SPS), focal SPS, and progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM). The most frequently associated antibodies are anti-GAD65, anti-GlyR, anti-amphiphysin, and anti-DPPX. Immunotherapy is the primary treatment modality. We present an illustrative case series of three patients: anti-GlyR antibody-mediated PERM presenting as rapidly progressive dementia; anti-amphiphysin antibody-mediated SPS; and SPS presentation with anti-Zic4 antibodies, spasmodic laryngeal stridor and fluctuating eyelid ptosis. Clinical characteristics, CSF findings, neurophysiological features, adequate immunological assays and a high suspicion index are essential for prompt diagnosis and management.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the diversity and clinical features of anti-glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) antibody-associated neurological diseases., METHODS: Clinical data of a series of 5 patients positive for anti-GAD antibodies were retrospectively analyzed., RESULTS: All 5 patients were female, with a median age of 41.5 years (range 19-60 years). Their neurological symptoms included stiff-person syndrome (SPS), encephalitis, myelitis, cramp, visual loss, and paresthesia. Three patients (60%) were diagnosed with tumors, 2 cases of thymic tumor and 1 of breast cancer. On immunohistochemistry for tumor pathology, expression of GAD65 was found only in 1 patient. Four patients (80%) had abnormal brain MRI findings. All patients received immunotherapy and improved significantly after treatment, but 4 (80%) then experienced a relapse., CONCLUSIONS: Neurological manifestations in anti-GAD-positive patients are diverse and include SPS, encephalitis, myelitis, cramp, visual loss, and paresthesia.

AB  - Background: Antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are associated with Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS)., Case report: A 50-year-old woman presented with symptoms progressed over 9 years, resulting in a cerebellar ataxia and right upper limb tremor. Investigations revealed elevated serum and CSF anti-GAD antibody titres (98.6 and 53.4 mu/ml, respectively). Treatment included intravenous immunoglobulin and immunomodulation (infliximab and rituximab), improving her stiffness, but with no impact on the ataxia-related symptoms. Subsequent high-dose steroids led to diabetic ketoacidosis and unmasking of an insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus., Discussion: This case illustrates several key features: (1) the combined clinical picture of SPS and cerebellar ataxia is a rare phenotype associated with anti-GAD antibodies; (2) the cerebellar ataxia described was progressive and poorly responsive to immunomodulatory therapy; and (3) the potential for development of further autoimmune sequelae in response to immunosuppression, namely, the development of insulin-dependent diabetes in response to treatment with high-dose oral steroids.

AB  - Objective: To describe novel clinical features of GlyRalpha1-IgG-positive patients., Methods: Patients with a positive serum GlyRalpha1-IgG were identified during a 2-year period from July 2016 to December 2018 at 2 academic centers and followed prospectively. All patients in this series were evaluated in the Neuroimmunology and Autoimmune Neurology clinics at the University of Utah or the University of Colorado., Results: Thirteen of 17 patients had phenotypes more typically associated with glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) antibody syndromes, consisting of stiff-person syndrome (SPS) with parkinsonism or cerebellar signs. One patient with parkinsonism had a presentation similar to rapidly progressive multiple system atrophy with severe dysautonomia. Ten of 17 patients had various visual symptoms including visual snow, spider web-like images forming shapes and 3-dimensional images, palinopsia, photophobia, visual hallucinations, synesthesia, and intermittent diplopia. Three of 17 patients presented with primarily autoimmune epilepsy accompanied by psychiatric symptoms., Conclusions: Clinicians should consider testing for GlyR antibodies in GAD65 antibody-negative or low-positive GAD65 antibody patients with SPS-like presentations, especially in the setting of atypical features such as visual disturbances, parkinsonism, or epilepsy.

AB  - Anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD) antibodies are linked with both autoimmune diabetes and the rare neurological disorder stiff person syndrome (SPS). SPS is an uncommon autoimmune-mediated condition characterized by painful episodic spasms and progressive muscle rigidity. We present the case of a 23-year-old non-diabetic, insulin-naive woman with known SPS who was hospitalized for SPS-related symptomatology. The patient quickly developed type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) with unexpectedly large insulin requirements. To our knowledge, there are no other reports describing rapid T1DM development during an acute hospitalization for SPS and fewer than 5 case reports describing the association of SPS with extreme insulin resistance. Our case highlights the key clinical features, pathology, and pathogenesis of both SPS and T1DM and explores the relationship between the two disease processes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the clinical characteristics of autoimmune encephalitis associated with the glutamate decarboxylase 65 (GAD 65) antibody., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of all patients that diagnosed with GAD 65 antibody-associated encephalitis were retrospectively analyzed. Data regarding demographics and symptoms, neurological signs, laboratory and imaging results, treatment and prognosis were collected., RESULTS: We collected a total of seven patients, mainly young or middle-aged women with a subacute or chronic course. The main clinical symptoms mainly included chronic epilepsy, cerebellar ataxia, stiff-person syndrome, and limbic encephalitis. Three of seven (43%) patients had high CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) protein levels. Oligoclonal IgG bands (including IgG 1) and 24 hours intrathecal synthesis of IgG were detected in CSF and serum in six patients, five patients (83%) reported increased distribution of oligoclonal IgG bands (including IgG 1) and 24 hours intrathecal synthesis of IgG in serum and CSF. And six of seven patients (86%) had abnormal thyroid function or were positive for thyroid antibodies. By electroencephalogram examination, sharp or slow waves in the temporal region were often observed for six of seven patients (86%). Abnormal imaging signals (six of seven patients, 86%) of the temporal lobe and hippocampus were detected by brain magnetic resonance imaging, and decreased metabolism of the temporal lobe was detected by positron emission tomography/computed tomography (six of six patients, 100%). These patients were mainly treated with corticosteroid and gamma globulin. The clinical symptoms of the patients were alleviated., CONCLUSIONS: The course of GAD 65 antibody-associated encephalitis is longer than other autoimmune encephalitides. The clinical symptoms of GAD 65 autoimmune encephalitis mainly manifested as chronic epilepsy, cerebellar ataxia, stiff-person syndrome, and limbic encephalitis, and combined with or without thyroid autoimmune diseases, type 1 diabetes, and thymoma. A comprehensive understanding of the disease is a way to prevent misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - We described the clinical and neuroimaging characteristics of seven Chinese patients with anti-GAD65 antibody-associated neurological disorders of whom epileptic seizures were the initial and main symptoms. All patients were given immunotherapy and followed up monthly. The outcome demonstrates that immunotherapy is helpful for non-seizure manifestations of anti-GAD65-associated neurological autoimmunity and is less effective in the treatment of seizures, yet partial responses can still occur in the early stage. Taken together we suggest a trial with immunotherapy in all patients in the early stage of the disease, and in patients with non-epilepsy symptoms in the later stage. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients positive for anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) antibodies have attracted increasing attention. Their clinical manifestations are highly heterogeneous and can be comorbid with tumors. Currently, there is no consensus on the therapeutic regimen for anti-GAD65-associated neurological diseases due to the clinical complexity, rarity and sporadic distribution. We reported six anti-GAD65 autoimmune encephalitis (AE) patients who received intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) or immunoglobulin (IVIG) or both. Then, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of both by summarizing results in previous anti-GAD65 AE patients from 70 published references., RESULTS: Our six patients all achieved clinical improvements in the short term. Unfortunately, there was no significant difference between IVMP and IVIG in terms of therapeutic response according to the previous references, and the effectiveness of IVMP and IVIG was 45.56% and 36.71%, respectively. We further divided the patients into different subgroups according to their prominent clinical manifestations. The response rates of IVMP and IVIG were 42.65% and 32.69%, respectively, in epilepsy patients; 60.00% and 77.78%, respectively, in patients with stiff-person syndrome; and 28.57% and 55.56%, respectively, in cerebellar ataxia patients. Among 29 anti-GAD65 AE patients with tumors, the response rates of IVMP and IVIG were 29.41% and 42.11%, respectively. There was no significant difference in effectiveness between the two regimens among the different subgroups., CONCLUSION: Except for stiff-person syndrome, we found that this kind of AE generally has a poor response to IVMP or IVIG. Larger prospective studies enrolling large numbers of patients are required to identify the optimal therapeutic strategy in the future.

AB  - Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is a procedure that reduces amount of circulating antibodies in patients through filtration for the treatment of neurologic diseases in which autoimmunity plays a major role. We reviewed the medical records of 92 neurologic patients who had been consecutively treated by TPE between June 2000 and April 2011 at Ankara University School of Medicine, Neurology Department and The Apaheresis Center. Neurological indications included myastehia gravis (MG, 16 patients), Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS, 37 patients) and miscellaneous diseases (39 patients). The median TPE session number was 5 with a range of 1-8; total number of TPE procedures in all cases was 454. All MG patients improved with TPE during their hospitalization time. Regarding GBS, nearly 67% of the patients improved early, during their hospitalization time, either. In our series, 25% of GBS cases died because of dysautonomia. TPE was not effective in the treatment of the patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, paraneoplastic polineuropathy, toxic polineuropathy, mononeuropathy multiplex in the case series. During the TPE procedures, 4 patients had hypotension and total number of the procedures was 21 in those patients. One patient had urticaria in only one session of total 5 TPE procedures. Two patients had septicemia; the first one had 3 and the second had 5 TPE procedures; both septic cases died. In conclusion, TPE is an effective treatment in neurologic diseases that autoimmunity plays an important role in the pathogenesis. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Introduction: Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune neurological disorder characterized by progressive stiffness and painful spasms in the trunk and lower extremities. Little information about physiotherapy management of SPS is found in the literature. The aim of this case report was to show the effects of inpatient physiotherapy management for a patient with SPS. Method(s): The patient was a 65-year-old female with SPS diagnosed 1 year before. She spent 31 days in hospital. Plasmapheresis sessions were performed 5 times for cerebellar symptoms. Initial assessments were range of motion, muscle strength, pain, balance, coordination, ambulation and function. She got pain in shoulders; visual analogue scale (VAS) was 5. Muscle strength was affected. She had sitting balance, however could not stand up and walk. Her Functional Mobility Profile (FMP) score was 35/63. She received physiotherapy for 14 sessions. It included mainly balance, coordination, posture, strengthening, stretching exercises, and repetitive task training. After gaining standing balance, walking exercises were applied. Result(s): Her coordination and muscle strength was increased. Her pain disappeared (VAS-0). Her static and dynamic balance improved dramatically and she started to walk with a walker at the 9th session. Her walking speed, distance and independence improved. The last FMP score was 49/63 and she could walk 20 m with a walker without rest. Conclusion(s): Considering plasmapheresis was performed for cerebellar symptoms, it seems that the resulting improvements are caused by physiotherapy. Inpatient physiotherapy management for SPS can be effective to improve function and the impairments associated with SPS.

AB  - Case Description: A 32-year-old woman, recently diagnosed with stiff person syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), presented with progressive upper and lower limb weakness and spasticity within a 5-year period. Physical examination findings were significant for increased tone in the upper and lower limbs and dystonia, suggestive of a mixed movement disorder with spontaneously occurring painful muscle spasms. Setting(s): Inpatient Rehabilitation Unit at an Academic Medical Center. Results or Clinical Course: During her rehabilitation stay, the patient underwent diagnostic workup that included testing for anti- glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody, which was negative, thus making the case for stiff person syndrome based on clinical examination. She received carbamazepine 200 mg twice per day, which managed her painful contractions, and oral baclofen for spasticity control. An intrathecal baclofen pump placed later in her rehabilitation stay significantly improved her spasticity and her ability to achieve functional goals in rehabilitation. Discussion(s): Stiff person syndrome is a rare neurological disorder characterized by rigidity in the symmetrical paraspinal and abdominal muscles, increased lordosis, a "tin soldier" gait pattern, and episodic spasms, which occur in response to environmental stimuli. Diagnostic testing includes electrodiagnostic studies and laboratory testing for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies, which is seronegative in 40% of the population. Baclofen (a gamma-aminobutyric acid (a GABAb agonist) acts to restore the balance of excitatory and inhibitory input to reduce muscle hyperactivity and spasticity. Intrathecal baclofen pumps deliver baclofen directly to the intrathecal space and may be used to manage spasticity when oral therapy has proven inadequate. Conclusion(s): This case highlights the use of an intrathecal baclofen pump for management of spasticity in a patient with clinical findings of stiff person syndrome.

AB  - Case Description: RS is a 55-year-old female and PL is a 48- year-old male admitted for stiff person syndrome (SPS) to an inpatient rehabilitation unit after intrathecal baclofen pump (ITB) placement. Both had previously failed oral baclofen, benzodiazepines, and intravenous immumoglubulin therapy. Both patients had SPS related symptoms included dysphagia, dysarthria, rigidity, weakness, and difficulty with ambulation leading to frequent falls. RS had elevated serum antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase; PL had an elevated level of unidentified protein in his cerebral spinal fluid. Setting(s): Inpatient Rehabilitation Unit of a University Hospital Results or Clinical Course: RS and PS improved with intrathecal pump placement in conjunction with physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT). Length of stay was 13 days for RS and 9 days for PS. RS improved with ambulation from minimal contact assist with a rollator to independence with ambulation. In OT, she improved with LE dressing from moderate assistance to modified independence. PL improved with ambulation from minimal contact assistance with a rollator to modified independence with a cane. In OT, he improved with LE dressing from supervision to modified independence. Both patients were followed in our outpatient clinic and had good motor improvement with the baclofen pump over 6 months later. Discussion(s): Stiff person syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder. Antibodies decrease the synthesis or release of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter, resulting in increased neuronal excitability. Patients report sudden rigidity resulting in falls, sometimes in response to emotional stimuli or a sudden noise. Inpatient rehabilitation allows for close coordination of ITB titration with intensive therapy in the setting of close monitoring for fall prevention, pain control, medication side effects, and psychiatric support. Conclusion(s): Intrathecal pump placement followed by an inpatient rehabilitation program should be considered in patients with SPS. This concords with the limited studies indicating that patients with SPS may benefit from intrathecal baclofen pumps or inpatient rehabilitation.

AB  - Background/Case Studies: Stiff-person syndrome is an uncommon disorder that presents with progressive muscle stiffness and spasms leading to limited patient ambulation. Most patients are positive for anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, and their presence or absence subdivides the syndrome into three variants: 1) autoimmune, 2) paraneoplastic, and 3) idiopathic. We present a 75-y-old female patient with sudden onset of subacute gait impairment and myoclonus. A serum/cerebral spinal fluid paraneoplastic panel was positive for amphiphysin [CSF 1:256 titer, serum 1:15360 titer/western blot (+)], a nonintrinsic membrane protein concentrated in nerve terminals, and she was subsequently diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma. Study Design/Methods: Our patient was treated with first-line immunosuppressive therapy Solu-Medrol 1 g x 5 doses, without improvement. Unresponsiveness prompted an intravenous immune globulin regimen of 0.4 g/kg/d for 5 d, which also did not yield the expected results. Apheresis has been described as a treatment option in patients with lifethreatening respiratory decline, but, in our case, the lack of clinical improvement with previous therapies warranted the use of this modality. Results/ Findings: Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) was performed by using a COBE (now GAMBRO) Spectra apheresis system (GAMBRO BCT, Inc., Lakewood, CO). Peripheral venous catheters were used for access and return. The patient underwent seven exchanges in the course of 2 wk, for a total 1.0 plasma volume exchange at 100% fluid balance with 2.5 L of 5% albumin as replacement fluid. Conclusion(s): All seven sessions were completed without any major adverse events. The only side effects described were brief episodes of cold intolerance and drowsiness secondary to antihistamine use, both of which became milder as the sessions progressed. TPE is usually a well-tolerated procedure, and the reported adverse event frequency is below 5%. Since last being treated, the patient had received Rituxan 375 mg/m2 weekly for 5 wk, and she since reports improvement with respect to muscle spasms and body pain, changes that have allowed her to tolerate a lower dose of Baclofen (30 mg daily, down from 45 mg). Her "stiff" and unsteady gait has improved when using a walker, and she is able to ambulate with more ease and without any falls. Although it is unclear how much of the clinical improvement can be attributed to the TPE sessions, that may be a valuable treatment modality in patients with stiff-person syndrome who are unresponsive to first-line therapies.

AB  - Background: Autoantibodies against the postsynaptic glycine receptor were recently reported in patients with variants of stiff-person syndrome (SPS). The glycine receptor was presumed an autoantibody target because several mutations in its two subunits are associated with hereditary hyperekplexia, which in some instances resembles SPS. In a cohort of patients with SPS and related movement disorders, we report autoantibodies against two further proteins of inhibitory glycinergic synapses, glycine receptor-clustering gephyrin and presynaptic glycine transporter 2 (GlyT2/SLC6A5). Method(s): Eukaryotic expression plasmids coding for authentic human GLRA1b, GLRB, gephyrin, GlyT2/SLC6A5, and ARHGEF9 were generated by insertion of full-length cDNAs into the pTriEx-1 vector. HEK293 expressing the recombinant proteins individually or in combination as well as an unrelated control were fixed with acetone. They were then used as substrates in indirect immunofluorescence to analyze IgG binding in sera from 44 patients with SPS, 30 with PERM, 7 with paroxysmal or truncal dystonia/dyskinesia, 6 with hyperekplexia, and 19with other neurological disorders aswell as from50 healthy controls. Result(s): Antibodies against GLRA1b were found in 5 patients. Two of them had been diagnosed with SPS, one with PERM, one with a paraneoplastic dystonia/dyskinesia accompanying breast cancer, and one with brain stem encephalitis comprising hyperekplexia. The encephalitis patient also harboured antibodies reacting with gephyrin (1:320) whereas antibodies against individual GLRB were not found, at all. One patient with suspected SPS and one with PERM exhibited antibodies against GlyT2/SLC6A5 (1:100, 1:320). Low titer antibodies against ARHGEF9 were found in one of the healthy controls (1:32). Conclusion(s): To our knowledge this is the first report on autoantibodies against presynaptic surface-expressed GlyT2/SLC6A5. Moreover, we report the second case of antibodies against postsynaptic intracellular gephyrin more than 10 years after the initial case report on a single SPS patient. The malicious influence of potentially in vivo bound anti-GlyT2/ SLC6A5 might add to or even cause attenuation of glycinergic transmission and thus release of brainstem and spinal inter- and motorneurons from physiological inhibition. This point should best be addressed in a passive antibody transfer model.

TI  - Autonomic dysfunction in stiff person syndrome (SPS): Observations in 8 cases
AU  - Barboi A. 
PY  - 2014
PD  - /
AB  - Objectives: Describe autonomic involvement in 8 consecutive patients with stiff person syndrome Background: SPS is mediated by antibodies to the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) enzyme. In addition to muscle stiffness and pain, patients may present with: cerebellar symptoms, progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM), multifocal presentations with rigidity, epilepsy and brainstem signs, limbic encephalitis, downbeat nystagmus. In multifocal cases symptoms of paroxysmal dysautonomia have been described. Method(s): Retrospective review of a series of consecutive SPS cases seen over the past 2 years. All patients underwent clinical evaluations, laboratory testing, GAD 65 antibody testing, electrophysiological testing (6 out of 8 patients) and autonomic testing. Autonomic testing included measurement of postganglionic sudomotor function (QSWEAT), heart rate to deep breathing, heart rate and blood pressure responses to the Valsalva maneuver and head up tilt table testing. Result(s): There were 3 men (average age 43) and 5 women (average age 51). Average time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 2 years for men and 6 years for women. Only one case (male) was antibody negative. Autonomic symptoms: 6 patients had sweating abnormalities, 5 patients had lower GI symptoms, 2 had upper GI symptoms: one gastroparesis and one progressive dysphagia, 5 had mild orthostatic intolerance and one had syncope, 3 had palpitations and 2 had urinary symptoms. Abnormalities on autonomic testing included: cardiovagal dysfunction in 3, orthostatic tachycardia in 3, combination of sympathetic vasomotor and cardiac sympathetic hypofunction in 2 and one patient had a length dependent sudomotor loss pattern. Conclusion(s): Autonomic involvement is not rare, may not just be paroxysmal and may occur early in the course of SPS. Autonomic involvement may be a clue to the diagnosis particularly in patients with only mild stiffness and pain..

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurologic disorder Characterized by severe axial and proximal limb rigidity and unexpected spasms due to continuous motor unit activity. There are SPS Several variants, including stiff trunk syndrome, stiff limbs syndrome, encephalomyelitis with rigidity progressive, SPS-plus, and paraneoplastic SPS. These syndromes are Often found in association with other autoimmune disorders such as diabetes mellitus in more than one thirds of all cases, and, less commonly, Those Caused by antithyroid, antinuclear and antiparietal cell antibodies. Glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (anti-GAD) are found in around 60 to 80% of SPS cases. GAD is a cytoplasmic enzyme que accelerates the conversion of glutamic acid to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter present in the brain and spinal cord. GAD Mainly is synthesized in presynaptic GABAergic neurons in the central nervous system and in the beta cells in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. Benzodiazepines and baclofen Have Been used the the main therapeutic interventions addressing the muscle rigidity and spam in These cases. Here, we described a patient with antiGAD positive SPS with marked improvement of muscle rigidity and spam after use of the new anticonvulsivant drug (levetiracetam).

AB  - Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) is a rare autoimmune neurological condition. Antibodies targeting glycine receptors (GlyR) have been implicated in PERM. Because GlyR activity is enhanced by inhaled anesthetic drugs at clinically relevant concentrations, there is a theoretical possibility that these drugs may be less effective in the presence of GlyR antibodies. We describe a case of general anesthesia in a patient with PERM and GlyR antibodies. This patient did not demonstrate a clinically significant alteration in the behavioral effects of anesthesia using induction of anesthesia with sevoflurane and maintenance of anesthesia using sevoflurane and nitrous oxide.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is manifested by increased tone of the trunk muscles that gradually spreads to the limbs. The mechanism underlying this muscle hypertonia involves derangement of the inhibitory action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at cortical and spinal levels with subsequent continuous motor unit activity. A co-contraction mechanism with a board-like abdomen and painful lumbar hyperlordosis plays an important role. Symptomatic treatment involves drugs that enhance inhibition (baclofen and benzodiazepines). Causal treatment focuses on immunosuppression (corticosteroids, intravenously administered immunoglobulins, and plasmapheresis). A combination of SPS and another genetic disease has not yet been described. We describe a case study of a 46-year-old man with gradual development of severe SPS whose electromyography (EMG) showed continuous motor unit activity as well as several myotonic discharges. Genetic testing was indicative of myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2).

AB  - Stiff limb syndrome (SLS) is a focal variant of the spectrum of stiff person syndrome. Its presentation with stiffness, limb posturing, and freezing-of-gait (FOG)-like episodes, together with the relative rareness of the disorder, make it conceivable that SLS might be misdiagnosed as atypical parkinsonism, in particular, corticobasal syndrome (CBS). To illustrate this, we present two cases of established SLS resembling CBS and discuss the distinguishing features that may alert the clinician to the correct diagnosis, with its obvious therapeutic and prognostic implications.Copyright © 2014 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We report a case of diagnostically delayed childhood onset Stiff Person Syndrome(SPS) associated with new onset, progressive scoliosis leading to a surgical correction prior to established diagnosis of SPS. BACKGROUND: Childhood onset SPS is rare, under recognized and at times misdiagnosed as a psychogenic disorder characterized by stiffness, rigidity and superimposed spasm of axial and lower extremity musculatures. It is aggravated by sudden movement, tactile stimulation, noise or emotional stress. Lumbar hyperlordosis is commonly reported. Scoliosis is unrecognized complication of SPS resulting from a prolonged and imbalanced increase in the paraspinal muscles tone. DESIGN/METHODS: Case report and review literature. A 20 years old African American woman recently had a posterior spinal fusion for her progressive scoliosis which began approximately 3 years after the initial onset of a prolonged history of stiffness in her back, gait difficulty, episodic painful back and lower extremities spasm which started at the age of 10. The spasms worsened following the surgery with minimal response despite large doses of baclofen, tizanidine, diazepam, and gabapentin.(Video) RESULTS: Serum anti GAD65 antibody was markedly elevated (5615 nmol/L). Negative result for amphiphysin antibody. She had normal thyroid function and no evidence of diabetes. The prolonged spasms resolved after the second treatment of monthly intravenous immunoglobulin infusion. Prednisone and dantrolene were also added. On follow up 3 months later, she still had occasional brief myoclonic jerks and remained wheel chair bound due to stiff back and hip despite a good postoperative alignment of the spine. CONCLUSION(S): In children and young adults with spinal column deformities including hyperlordosis or new scoliosis, the diagnosis of SPS should be considered since early treatment may help reduce long term complications, disability and improve the quality of life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Rhabdomyolysis has been described in the paraneoplastic variant, but to our knowledge no case has been reported involving the autoimmune variant. BACKGROUND: Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurologic disorder characterized by waxing and waning muscular rigidity, stiffness and spasms. Three subtypes have been described: paraneoplastic, autoimmune and idiopathic. Rhabdomyolysis is a clinical syndrome caused by an injury to skeletal muscle and involves the release of intracellular contents into the plasma. It leads to a wide spectrum of severity of illness from asymptomatic increases in serum muscle enzymes to potential life-threatening disease from the muscle enzyme elevations, electrolyte disturbances, and acute kidney injury. DESIGN/METHODS: A 50-year-old man with recurrent episodes of severe limb and back spasms was diagnosed with SPS by positive serum antiglutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies. RESULT(S): He was hospitalized on two separate occasions for uncontrollable limb and back spasms and associated generalized weakness with creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) elevations of 55,000 and 22,000 U/L, respectively. He also was noted to be in acute renal failure during both admissions with elevations of his serum creatinine. Laboratory tests were otherwise unremarkable. The acute renal failure resolved during both admissions with supportive management only including aggressive rehydration with intravenous fluids as well as the use of various skeletal muscle relaxants. CONCLUSION(S): The pathophysiology of autoimmuneSPS (aSPS) is thought to be due to inhibition of GAD by anti-GAD antibodies. Inhibition of GAD results in functional inhibition of gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA) which in turn causes muscles to become continuously stimulated by the motor neurons leading clinically to the muscle spasms. Rhabdomyolysis, diagnosed by significant elevation in CPK, can be seen in a-SPS. Rhabdomyolysis has the potential to be fatal and early diagnosis is essential and should be considered in patients who have SPS and are experiencing an exacerbation of their neurologic symptoms.

AB  - Background and aims: Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a severe, debilitating disease that is characterised by fluctuating degrees of rigidity and stiffness of the axial and lower limb muscles as well as positive serology for either the anti- GAD antibody, anti-ampiphysin antibody or the anti-islet pancreatic cell antibody. It has a prevalence estimated to be one in one million persons. Because of the rarity of this condition, no randomised controlled trials have been done to ascertain the effectiveness of the various treatment options currently available for the treatment of Stiff person syndrome as well as how they compare to each other. There have only been two reported cases of SPS in South Africa until 2013. Since then more patients have met the DALAKAS criteria for the diagnosis of typical SPS. Case Reports: We aim to describe the treatment of three SPS patients over a two year period. We will include a comparative analysis of their current treatment modalities including those for co-morbid psychiatric illnesses as well as patient preferences. Result(s): All three patients improved significantly with immunoglobulin therapy at 3-4 month intervals to alleviate stiffness and rigidity. Oral medication alone was ineffective for complete management. Conclusion(s): In a limited resource setting, the holistic management of stiff person syndrome becomes very difficult because of reduced availability of drugs prescribed for symptom control or immunological agents for disease modification. Despite the high cost, we also advocate the routine use of intravenous immunoglobulin every three to four months because of improved functional ability that is sustainable for that period.

AB  - Background: In patients with glycine receptor antibodies (GlyRAb), a range of neurological syndromes that includes Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) and its more severe variant Progressive Encephalitis with Rigidity and Myoclonus (PERM) have recently been reported in a predominantly adult cohort (Carvajal-Gonzalez et al., Brain 2014;137(Pt 8):2178-92). Objective(s): To report the clinical features and outcome of children with GlyR-Ab. Method(s): Cases were identified from samples sent to the Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurology, Oxford for a range of neuronal surface antibody testing. Result(s): Six girls with a mean age of 8 years (median 7.5; range 1-15) were identified (2 London, 1 Oxford, and 3 Australia). The children presented with refractory focal seizures (n=2), or cognitive/behavioural changes (n=4) of whom two had tremor and gait abnormalities and one features of PERM. During the course of the illness, seizures featured in 5 patients and cognitive/behavioural changes in all. Electroencephalogram (EEG) during the illness revealed features of encephalopathy (n=3) and focal/multifocal epileptiform discharges (n=2). Two children had early imaging features of brain inflammation, and in another 2, global atrophy were identified on serial imaging despite normal acute scans. GlyR-Abs were detected in the serum (n=6) and/or CSF (n=2). Co-occurrence of low levels (<400 pmol) VGKC-Abs were identified in 2 patients, and no further neuronal surface antibodies or GAD-Abs were found. Intrathecal oligoclonal bands were identified in 1/5 tested. Immune modulation improved seizure control transiently in one patient. One patient had normal neurological function at 5 month follow-up (untreated), and one patient died after 5 years. Ongoing cognitive impairment occurred in 4 children and ongoing seizure disorder in 3. Conclusion(s): The paediatric phenotype is predominated by female sex, seizures, and, where PERM occurs, it is associated with additional features. The clinical relevance of GlyR antibodies needs to be determined, to help guide therapies.

AB  - Objective: To describe a young girl in whom stimulus sensitive spasms were a diagnostic clue to the underlying glycine receptor antibody mediated progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) which has been described mainly in adults. Method(s): We illustrate the clinical data from the case-notes with a video recording of stimulus-sensitive spasms. Result(s): A previously well 15-year-old girl presented with a traumatic head injury after falling down the stairs. The noise from a doorbell had triggered a severe muscle spasm causing the fall. She sustained a complex skull fracture with coup-contrecoup brain injury. She had previously been evaluated over five months for stimulus-sensitive whole body spasms with axial hyperextension without impairment of consciousness. She also had daily stimulus-sensitive myoclonic jerks, headaches and subtle cognitive impairment over the preceding year. Whilst on the paediatric intensive care unit, she was noted to have spontaneous and stimulus-sensitive muscle spasms (EMG duration 360-680 ms with no EEG correlate). She also developed generalised tonic clonic seizures, which were treated with Levetiracetam. A diagnosis of PERM was considered and glycine receptor antibodies were found to be strongly positive in serum and CSF. VGKCcomplex antibodies were also weakly positive but GAD and NMDAR antibodies were negative. Oligoclonal bands were positive in CSF but negative in serum. Paraneoplastic antibodies were negative. Brain MRI showed contusions in the right hemisphere. Body imaging did not identify any tumours. Glycine receptor gene analysis is awaited. Her spasms have improved with a residual mild startle response to touch or loud auditory stimuli. She has a residual left hemiparesis. She was not treated with immunomodulation but will be followed up, and immunotherapy considered if she does not continue to improve and antibodies persist. Conclusion(s): Glycine receptor antibody-mediated progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus can present in children as stimulus-sensitive muscle spasms.

AB  - Objective: Stimulus sensitivity in the context of burst- suppression has been recognised, whereby signs only emerge after 24 hours of barbiturate infusion and disappear when this is reduced. We report clinical neurophysiological findings in a 15 year old child with persistent burst-suppression stimulus sensitivity, with a prior history of stimulus sensitive jerks. She developed a clinical picture of progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) and was subsequently found to have glycine receptor antibodies. Method(s): Continuous EEG recording with concomitant stimulation using a strobe light. Result(s): 1. We observed stimulus sensitivity in our patient in response to tactile, visual and auditory stimulation, persisting for days after withdrawal of the barbiturate. 2. In a normal cortex, the neurons usually have a refractory period within the first 2.5s after the end of the preceding burst. In our patient we were able to elicit a burst within this refractory period, indicating cortical hyperexcitability. 3. An abnormal end of train response was seen, suggestive of altered inhibition and excitation mechanisms. 4. This child was subsequently shown to have glycine receptor antibodies. Conclusion(s): Glycine receptors are expressed in brainstem, spinal cord and thalamus. We hypothesize that inactivation of the glycine receptor at the level of the thalamus results in reduction of hyperpolarisation and consequent increase in excitation, thus causing hyperexcitability. Other stimulus induced discharges (SIRPIDs) are also thought to arise via thalamocortical activation combined with hyperexcitable cortex. This study implicates the glycinergic pathway in cortical hyperexcitability and provides novel insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying stimulus sensitivity, possibly facilitated by the barbiturate infusion in an intensive care setting, as in our case.

AB  - Objective: To determine the spectrum and prevalence of antibodies associated with Stiff Person Syndrome and related disorders (SPSD) in a large cohort. Background(s): New antibodies targeting the glycine receptor (GlyR), GABA A receptor (GABAAR), and dipeptidyl-peptidase-like protein-6 (DPPX) have been recently described in SPSD. Such neuronal surface antibodies are deemed pathogenic and to be associated with a better response to immunotherapy compared to the hitherto known antibodies against intracellular antigens like glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), amphiphysin, and gephyrin. Method(s): We included 73 SPSD patients (SPS=44; SLS=6; PERM=23) and 5 patients with acquired hyperekplexia, 3 of them with brainstem encephalitis. Previous positive antibody results (laboratories Prof Vincent, Oxford, and University Hospital Heidelberg) were included in the evaluation. For antibody detection we used indirect immunofluorescence applying frozen tissue sections (rat: hippocampus, cerebellum; monkey: cerebellum) and recombinant cell substrates, each expressing a different neuronal antigen [GABABR, GABAAR (A1+B3), GlyR, GAD65, amphiphysin, gephyrin, DPPX, SLC6A5/GlyT2]. Result(s): 54 SPSD sera contained GAD-ab (SPS=31; PERM=19; SLS=4). 7 of the GAD-ab positive sera harboured also GlyR-ab (n=1, SPS), GlyT2-ab (n=2, PERM), or amphiphysin-ab (low titre n=3, 1 SPS, 1 PERM; high titre n=1, paraneoplastic SPS). 3 SPS patients had high titres of amphiphysin-ab; in 2 cases a paraneoplastic aetiology was established, for 1 patient data were incomplete. GlyR-ab were present in 9 sera (SPS=7, PERM=2); in 3 of these, other antibodies were also present (low titre DPPX-ab, n=2 (SPS), GAD-ab in 1 SPS patient). DPPX-ab at high titres were present in 2 sera of previously reported PERM patients. 1 patient with brainstem encephalitis with hyperekplexia had GlyR-ab and gephyrin-ab. No antibodies were detected in the remaining hyperekplexia patients and in 6 SPSD patients. No patient had GABAAR-ab. Conclusion(s): We found antibodies against the presynaptic surface-expressed GlyT2 for the first time and report the second case with gephyrin-ab. Altogether, GAD-ab were the most prevalent (74%) followed by GlyR-ab (17%). Amphiphysin-ab were most frequently associated with paraneoplastic disease. DPPX-ab and GABAAR-ab seem not to be frequent in SPSD. Multiple antibodies occurred overall in 13%. We did not observe any phenotype-serotype correlation which might guide antibody testing.

AB  - Objective: To present a case report of anti-GAD65 negative stiffperson syndrome with a favorable response to pregabalin accompanying central sleep apnea. Background(s): Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare immunemediated disorder characterized by muscle stiffness and painful spasms. Circulating antibodies against the 65-kDa isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-65) block gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) synthesis, resulting in dysfunction of GABAergic inhibitory pathways and consequently clinical manifestation. Method(s): We present a 48-year-old woman developing clinically severe anti-GAD65 negative SPS following thymoma excision. Result(s): The patient experienced paroxysmal painful spasms predominant in abdomen and both proximal leg muscles. Electromyography of lower limbs and paraspinal muscles revealed continuous motor unit activity at rest that could be terminated by diazepam. Due to severe drug dependence and side effects of benzodiazepine, pregabalin was prescribed with simultaneous benzodiazepine decrement. Dramatic improvements in rigidity, painfulness were observed afterward. To our knowledge, the patient is the first case that not only develops SPS syndrome after thymectomy but also responds favorably to pregabalin. Two years later after SPS attack, daytime somnolence and central sleep apnea developed, firstly reported and diagnosed by overnight polysomnogram and multiple sleep latency test, and was controlled after intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. Conclusion(s): Here we firstly report a case of anti-GAD65 negative SPS after thymoma excision that has a favorable response to pregabalin accompanying central sleep apnea, which may be related to SPS progression, implicating brainstem and respiratory center gradually, but the exact pathogenesis remains unknown, and needs further investigation.

AB  - GAD65-antibodies associate with several neurological syndromes. It is unknown whether different epitopes or coexisting antibodies relate to distinct syndromes. 121 patients with GAD antibody-associated syndromes without or with cancer including, stiff-person syndrome (SPS), cerebellar ataxia, limbic encephalitis, and paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS) were investigated with multiple GAD65 antibody-detecting techniques (brain immunohistochemistry, ELISA, cell-based assays [CBA]), and GAD65-deletion mutants. Other antibodies tested included GAD67, cellsurface receptors (GABAa, GABAb, GlyR, NMDA, AMPA), and amphiphysin/gephyrin. No significant difference among epitope regions and syndromes was detected. All patients were negative for amphiphysin/gephyrin antibodies. Studies with live neurons and confocal microscopy showed no GAD-antibody internalization (in contrast to NMDAR-antibodies that were co-internalized with the receptor). Patients with ataxia and limbic encephalitis had higher CSF GAD65-antibody titers than those with SPS (p=0.02). Patients with PNS had more coexisting CSF cellsurface antibodies (53% vs. 11%; p<0.001) and less GAD67-antibodies (57% vs. 100%, p<0.001) than non- PNS patients. Paraneoplastic patients were older (median 60 vs. 48 years, p=0.03), more frequently male (60% vs. 13%, p<0.001) and developed classical PNS (limbic encephalitis or opsoclonus). In GAD-syndromes, the association with classical PNS and cell-surface antibodies should prompt cancer screening.

AB  - Summary Introduction: The stiff-person syndrome is a rare neurological disorder characterized by marked axial stiffness with severe hyperlordosis and painful muscle spasms, which can be triggered by sensory and emotional stimuli. The antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) suggest an autoimmune etiology. Various treatments (benzodiazepines, baclofen, botulinum toxin, immunoglobulin and immunosuppressive therapy) have been used with varying response. Case report: The case of a female patient of 20 years, with clinical picture of one and a half axial hypertension and left-sided, marked lumbar lordosis and very painful muscle spasms axial paroxysmal is reported; progressive course. Additional tests are performed: oligoclonal bands with pattern 2 and anti-GAD positive serum; occult tumor (total body PET normal) is discarded. Diagnosis of stiffperson syndrome autoimmune done. Management starts with benzodiazepines, baclofen and immunoglobulin for 4 cycles (2 g/ kg every 2 months); without obtaining a sustained clinical response to axial muscle spasms and the lumbar lordosis. It was decided to apply botulinum toxin type A (Dysport) 500 U distributed in lumbar, thoracic and cervical paraspinal musculature; evidencing the fifth day a resolution of muscle spasms and improvement in lumbar lordosis (pre-90degree and post-76degree angle), achieving improvement in the patient's pain, posture and obtaining an independent way. Conclusion(s): The use of botulinum toxin can be a good therapeutic option for the management of pain and muscle spasms that do not respond to other treatments for people with stiff-person syndrome. The use of botulinum toxin is a therapeutic alternative to improve posture of these patients associated hyperlordosis.

AB  - A 64-year-old Filipino man presented with a one-month history of progressive left thigh rigidity and involuntary muscle contraction observed during knee extension, ankle plantarflexion and inversion. Volitional movement and noise aggravated the condition, and prolonged episodes of spasms were associated with pain. This affected ambulation and eventually necessitating the use of crutches. There was increased tone of the rectus femoris, vastus lateralis and vastus medialis muscles of the left leg. All affected muscles were hard on palpation. Marked rigidity was more prominent when patient is observed during ambulation. Neurologic examination was unremarkable. Deep tendon reflexes were normal. Electromyographic and nerve conduction studies (EMG NCV) studies showed sustained interference patterns consisting of normal motor unit action potentials which is consistent with Stiff Person Syndrome. Anti-glutamic acid antibody (anti-GAD Ab) determination was negative. Oral benzodiazepine and baclofen afforded relief of spasms and stiffness and resulted in improvement of functional status. SPS is an important diagnosis to consider in patients presenting with muscle stiffness, spasms and cramps. It may present as a paraneoplastic condition usually associated with lung and breast cancer and may indicate the presence of autoimmune disease. This condition causes significant morbidity and mortality. When properly diagnosed, most cases respond to appropriate treatment resulting to improvement of symptoms. Further investigation for the presence of paraneoplastic conditions especially in seropositive cases is highly recommended. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Background: Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune-mediated neuromuscular disorder causing disabling muscle stiffness. A better understanding of the clinical presentation and response to therapy may help neurologists better identify and treat SPS. Objective(s): To review the clinical course of patients diagnosed with SPS at a large neuromuscular referral center. Method(s): We performed a retrospective chart review of patients seen at the University of Kansas Medical Center between 2001 and 2014 with a diagnosis of SPS in our Neuromuscular Research Database. Result(s): Patients with SPS (n = 14) were predominately female (70%), with an average age of onset of 39.7 years. Symptom onset was in the lower extremity in 57.1%, in the back in 28.6%, and generalized in 14.3%. Over time, diffuse involvement was seen in 42.9% of patients. Less typical features included limb weakness (57.1%) and diplopia (28.6%). Autoimmune work up revealed GAD antibodies in all patients; none had acetylcholine receptor antibodies. Common co-morbidities included: diabetes (35.7%); thyroid disease (42.9%); anxiety and/or depression (50%); and seizure disorder (35.7%). Only 1 patient had associated rectal cancer. Electromyography (EMG) frequently revealed continuous motor unit activity in 8/12. MRI showed cerebellar atrophy in 1/12. Although the majority (86%) had symptomatic improvement with oral baclofen or benzodiazepines, most patients also required immunomodulatory therapies. The best response was seen to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG, in 6/9). Plasmapheresis was less effective (benefiting 1/3) and rituximab was ineffective (0/2). No patient achieved drug-free remission. Conclusion(s): SPS begins mostly in the legs, but diffuse involvement over the disease course is found in approximately half of patients. Continuous motor unit activity on EMG was seen in 2 thirds of patients. While most patients respond to oral symptomatic treatment or IVIG, no treatment leads to remission.

AB  - A 47-year previously fit and well lady presented with 6 weeks history of generalised lethargy, weight loss and neck pain. Her examination revealed left supra-clavicular lymph nodes. Subsequent investigations revealed left grade 2 invasive ductal carcinoma of her left breast. This was treated with local excision. She presented to hospital four weeks following her surgery with progressive double vision and unsteadiness. Her cranial nerve examination showed severly restricted pursuit and saccadic horizontal eye movements with intact vertical eye movements. She had normal strength with intact deep tendon reflexes with plantar flexor response. Her MRI head and spine with contrast and CSF examination, including cytology was normal. Two weeks into her admission she progressively developed generalised stiffness and severe axial and peripheral rigidity which was made worse with touch or emotions. These symptoms responded to benzodiazepines and baclofen. Her antiamphiphysin antibodies were positive confirming the diagnosis of stiff person syndrome. Her breast cancer was treated aggressively with chemotherapy. Her stiffness and rigidity improved briefly following her chemotherapy. Eye movement's problems were described in anti-GAD related stiff person syndrome, which is due to GABA depletion. This is first ever-reported case where eye movement problem (Stiff eyes) is the initial presentation of a anti-amphiphysin antibody related stiff person syndrome.

PD  - /
AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a chronic, progressive neurological disorder characterized by painful muscle spasms and rigidity with high titres of circulating anti-GAD antibodies. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) has been proven to be very effective in reducing the symptoms associated with SPS, most notably stiffness. Patients report being able to walk for the first time in months or even years and partake in activities of daily living including showering and household chores. A reduction in falls is also noted in patients receiving IVIg. Most patients report a drastically improved quality of life after receiving IVIg with significant improvement in pain, general mental health, social functioning, vitality and energy. At present, there is no standardised method of monitoring the effectiveness of IVIg treatment in patients with stiff person syndrome. We devised a standardised questionnaire with a combination of modified Rankin scale and Flanagan's QOLS and prospectively studied 12 SPS patients receiving IVIg therapy. We named this the Birmingham Response to IVIg Treatment (BRIT) scale. The BRIT scale can be used to monitor IVIg efficacy in a variety of chronic neurological conditions (especially ones without other monitoring tools, eg: INCAT score for CIDP) and would be a very useful addition to the neurology practice.

AB  - Stiff Person syndrome (SPS) is a chronic autoimmune neurological disorder causing muscle stiffness, excessive startle and pain. Patients often have anti-GAD and occasionally antiamphiphysin antibodies (especially in the paraneoplastic forms). There is no clear age, sex or race predilection clearly identified. Immunomodulatroy therapy with plasma exchange and IVIg is often beneficial in most patients. We systematically looked at patients with a diagnosis of SPS with positive antibodies. 12 of these patients were evaluated in detail for their clinical features, concomitant illness and immunological status. We also evaluated the treatment response of these patients using a locally developed rating scale combining the functional activity and quality of life scores (BRIT scale- submitted as another abstract). Many patients had a long delay between the onset of symptoms and the final diagnosis. It was also noted that a good proportion of patients had certain behavioural and personality changes which could well be attributed to the disease, rather than by chance. More than 80% of patients had significant response to immunomodulatory therapy, although the duration of remission/response was variable. This is one of the largest cohorts of SPS patients looked after in a single centre, which gives an insight into the clinical characterstics and immunological response of this rare neuroimmunological disorder.

TI  - Status spasticus and psoas muscle edema due to anti-GAD antibody associated stiff-man syndrome
AU  - Maramattom B.V.

AB  - Severe muscle rigidity and spasms are uncommon causes of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions. Stiff-man syndrome (SMS) is a rare disorder characterized by continuous muscle spasms, axial muscle rigidity, "tin soldier gait," and continuous motor unit activity on electromyography. There are three clinical variants of SMS; stiff-limb syndrome, classical SMS, and paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus. Three types of antibodies have been associated with SMS; however, anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies are the most frequent and are seen in the idiopathic type of SMS. The spasms of SMS can be very disabling and severe enough to cause muscle ruptures and skeletal fractures. We present a case of anti-GAD positive SMS with "status spasticus" causing bilateral psoas myoedema and rhabdomyolysis due to repeated axial muscle jerking in a 64-year-old man and discuss the differential diagnosis of a "jerking patient in the ICU."Copyright © 2015 Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine  Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.

AB  - RATIONALE: Altered cytokine levels, such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, have been described in common variable immunodeficiency (CVID).We report 3 cases of elevated serum interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) levels in patients with CVID. METHOD(S): A retrospective chart review was performed of 3 CVID patients with elevated IL-1beta. RESULT(S): Case 1 is a 56 year-old female with CVID and Hashimoto's thyroiditis who developed muscle stiffness, arthralgias and daily fevers (Tmax 104F) which persisted despite intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), antibiotics, corticosteroids, NSAIDs and rituximab. An autoinflammatory disorder was suspected when she was found with elevated IL-1beta 22.9 pg/ mL (nL < 3.9) and responded to anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist) with resolution of symptoms and normalization of IL-1beta levels. Case 2 is a 49 year-old male with CVID complicated by incapacitating arthritis and nodular lymphoid hyperplasia of the intestine with malabsorptive diarrhea which improved with IVIG. An elevated IL-1beta 68.7 pg/ mL was found when he presented with recurrent lowgrade fevers, myalgias and upper extremity muscle weakness with fasciculations. Anakinra was considered, but symptoms resolved and IL-1beta normalized on high-dose IVIG (1.5 grams/kg). Case 3 is a 26 year-old female with CVID on IVIG and stiff-person's syndrome with limited improvement on corticosteroids, benzodiazepines and rituximab. She was found with an elevated IL-1beta 18.6 pg/mL after complaining of daily flu-like symptoms with fevers (Tmax 101F) which improved with anakinra but her muscle stiffness still persists. CONCLUSION(S): Patients with CVID and autoimmune complications may have altered levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1beta. They may be responsive to treatment with anakinra or high-dose IVIG.

AB  - Objective: Report two cases of SPS with atypical manifestations Background: Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimune movement disorder, characterized by muscular rigidity, painful muscle spasms predominantly affecting paraspinal muscles. Method(s): Collect data from medical records and compare to medical literature. Result(s): PATIENT 1: 60-year-old woman started presenting shakings in her right lower limb associated to cramps and instability three years ago. She also manifested dystonia-like postures of the limb extremity, but without pattern of repetition. Support was indispensable to walk. She developed panic disorder and severe startle reflex. Serology for anti-GAD was positive. Immunoglobulin therapy provided decrease in falls and dystonic movements; stiffness was sustained. PATIENT 2: 47-year-old woman, with type 2 diabetes, started presenting painful spasms and rigidity of lower limbs 16 years ago. The symptoms intensified and ascended to upper limbs. She used to fall, developed fear of walking and became bedridden. She also showed startle reflexes. Moreover, it was detectable scanning speech, dysmetria nystagmus and movement decomposition. Anti-GAD was positive. ENMG evinced continuous firing of paravertebral and limb muscles. MRI displayed cerebellar atrophy (Fig. 1). High doses of benzodiazepines and muscle relaxers attenuated the painful spasms. Conclusion(s): Stiff-Person Syndrome is a rare disorder described by muscle rigidity and spasms. Limb dystonia is an atypical manifestation and may be explained by decreased GABA-inhibition which could lead to excessive plasticity and functional impairment. Cerebellar ataxia in SPS has been documented in few cases; our second case endorses the possible association between GAD-Abs and cerebellar ataxia.

AB  - Objective: Stiff person syndrome is an autoimmune disease that typically presents with symptoms of proximal limb and axial muscle rigidity and spasms and is often associated with glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) autoantibodies. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) population represents the largest integrated health care system in the United States, allowing for characterization of rare disease within a geographically and ethnically diverse population of patients. Background(s): To describe the demographics and clinical characteristics of stiff person syndrome within the national VHA population. Method(s): We performed a retrospective review of patients within the VHA population meeting the following criteria: 1. At least one ICD-9-CM code 333.91 for stiff person syndrome; 2. A positive result by intelligent keyword search of patient documents, defined as any of the following words occurring singly or in combination: stiffman syndrome, stiff-man syndrome, stiffperson syndrome, stiff-person syndrome, GAD65, GAD-65, GAD 65, glutamate decarboxylase, valium, diazepam, benzodiazepine, and baclofen. Duplicate records were deleted. Result(s): We identified 79 unique patients (67 male, 11 female) meeting the above criteria, and characterized them as either classic, variant, or PERM variant of stiff person syndrome, or other disease mimics, such as other GAD65-associated autoimmunity. The stiff person cases are described in terms of relevant demographics and clinical data, including age at symptom onset, misdiagnoses, associated autoimmunity, and response to symptomatic therapy and/or immunotherapy. Conclusion(s): This is the first ever comprehensive characterization of stiff person syndrome within the diverse national VHA population. Evaluation of stiff person syndrome within the VHA population allows for long-term disease evaluation and response to treatment.

TI  - Stiff-person syndrome exacerbated with serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor use
AU  - Benavides D.
AU  - Newsome S. 
PY  - 2016
PD  - /
AB  - Objective: To describe cases of Stiff-Person Syndrome (SPS) that clinically worsened following initiation or increase in dosage of serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). We provide a potential mechanism for these effects and suggest a paradigm for the management of patients with SPS with pain complaints treated with SNRIs. Background(s): SPS is a rare neurological disorder characterized by muscle stiffness, rigidity, and spasms. It is associated with antibodies that target gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons, particularly the rate-limiting enzyme in GABA biosynthesis, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). These antibodies are implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease, as they bind GABAergic terminals and have been shown to reduce GABA synthesis. Clinical exacerbations may be triggered by anxiety and panic attacks, which may alter endogenous serotonin and norepinephrine levels, and are often characterized by muscle spasms. Method(s): A retrospective case series was performed in patients admitted to the hospital or evaluated in clinic for SPS exacerbation who were treated with duloxetine. Clinically definite SPS was diagnosed in patients based on serum titers of anti-GAD65 antibodies. Result(s): Here we report four cases of SPS that developed clinical exacerbations following initiation or increase in dosage of duloxetine. Clinical exacerbations included worsening musculoskeletal symptoms (increased muscle stiffness, worsened pain, increased muscle spasms, and gait instability) as well as respiratory distress. All patients experienced improved clinical symptoms after withdrawal of duloxetine. Conclusion(s): The immunopathogenesis of SPS remains unknown. Here we report the association of clinical SPS exacerbations following SNRI use. We propose a model to describe the relationship between these neurotransmitters and the clinical syndrome. These cases suggest the importance of investigating the relationship between SNRIs and SPS in a prospective case-control study. Early recognition and careful review of medication use may improve disease severity and exacerbations in SPS.

AB  - Purpose: Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurologic autoimmune disease characterized by progressive axial and proximal limb rigidity, agonist and antagonist muscle contraction, and intermittent muscular spasms precipitated by various stimuli. Autoantibodies against antigens found predominately within the inhibitory synapses of the central nervous system is a common finding. Up to 85% exhibit antibodies directed against 65-kDa glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), an enzyme responsible for the synthesis of gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA). Therapeutic Plasma Exchange (TPE) has been used as an adjunct therapy with clinical benefit in patients who do not respond well to immunosuppressive/immunomodulating modalities including IVIG, muscle relaxants or anticonvulsants. Although TPE for SPS is an ASFA category III indication, there is a paucity of clinical information to support its use with no randomized trials data. We performed a retrospective review of patients to evaluate the therapeutic utility of TPE in SPS patients. Method(s): A retrospective chart review was performed in five patients with the clinical diagnosis of anti-GAD65 positive SPS. Result(s): Five patients (4 females, mean age at diagnosis 53 years; range 36 to 67), with the presumptive diagnosis of SPS with positive GAD-65 autoantibodies were identified from 2010 to 2015. The main indication for TPE was worsening of symptoms characteristic of SPS; varied degrees of stiffness, tenacious muscle rigidity, and/or overactive startle response affecting balance and gait. Four patients underwent a course of outpatient TPE (1-1.2 vol, 5% albumin replacement fluid); one patient was hospitalized for an acute exacerbation of SPS. Patients in outpatient setting received an initial TPE course of 5 procedures over 10-11 days, followed by taper to a chronic maintenance, with the frequency of TPE guided by the clinical response. The hospitalized patient initially received 5 TPEs (two consecutive days of procedures followed by alternating days) of 1.0 volume exchange with calcium gluconate supplementation. Improvement in upper and lower extremity rigidity was noted following the second TPE with dramatic improvement by the end of the course; two additional TPEs were performed prior to discharge, for a total of 7 procedures. The patient was discharged on baclofen, but was lost for follow up. Of the four patients that underwent maintenance TPE, two experienced transient improvements with further disease progression, while two had sustained improvement with stable symptoms. One of the patients with sustained benefits from chronic TPE experienced a relapse of symptoms when the interval between procedures was increased to greater than 14 days. A similar exacerbation of symptoms was noted in one of the patients that reported transient improvements following a two-week prolongation of her monthly maintenance TPE. The two patients with sustained improvements continue to undergoing chronic TPE maintenance therapy at our institution, and report a decrease in the frequency and intensity of exacerbations along with improved gait. Conclusion(s): Our study supports previous reports that TPE may be beneficial for the management of patients with anti-GAD65 positive SPS, both for acute exacerbations and long-term maintenance, either as an adjunct therapy, or in lieu of treatment with disease modifying agents.

AB  - Background and aims: Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) is a rare and severe neurological syndrome characterized by muscular rigidity and spasms with brainstem and autonomic dysfunction. It can be associated with anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), glycine receptor (GlyR) and dipeptidyl peptidaselike protein 6 (DPPX) antibodies. All of these autoantibodies may be associated with variable frequency to malignant tumours and their response to immunotherapy, as well as tumour removal, is also not easily predictable. Method(s): A 60-year-old man presented with a 6-month history of low back pain and progressive rigidity of the trunk and lower limbs, followed by pruritus, dysphonia, hyperhydrosis and urinary retention. Brain and spinal imaging were normal. EMG showed involuntary motor unit hyperactivity. Onconeural, anti- GAD, VGKC-complex and DPPX autoantibodies were negative. CSF was negative. Symptoms partially responded to baclofen, gabapentin and clonazepam, but he eventually developed severe dysphagia. Result(s): Anti-GlyR antibodies were positive on both serum and CSF and a plasmapheresis cycle was completed with good clinical response. A PET scan highlighted a metabolically active axillary lymphnode, that turned out to be a classic type Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), in the absence of bone marrow infiltration nor B symptoms. Polychemotherapy with ABVD protocol is still ongoing. Conclusion(s): PERM has already been described in association with HL, but this is the first case report of a HL manifesting as antiGlyR antibodies related PERM. Our report highlights the importance of malignancy screening in autoimmune syndromes of suspected paraneoplastic origin.

AB  - Background and aims: Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune neuromuscular disease, characterised by progressive, fluctuating muscular rigidity with superimposed intense spasms. Usually, axial and proximal appendicular muscles are affected at presentation. Less frequently, limb involvement may overwhelm axial involvement and, even more rarely, more than one limb can be afflicted. Method(s): Case report. Result(s): A 61-year-old woman presented to our care with a progressive history of significant rigidity and hyperextension of the left leg with toe retraction, and muscular spasms triggered by touch, sound and anxiety. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed frontoparietal hyperintense subcortical white matter signals on fluid attenuation inversion recovery. At this point, further investigation was unremarkable, including whole spine MRI. Focal dystonia was assumed, without response to levodopa/carbidopa. She was also treated with gabapentin, baclofen, venlafaxin and biperiden. Although some improvement was initially noticed, 4 months later her right leg, right arm and trunk were also affected, rendering her unable to walk and causing massive right rotator cuff tear and episodes of lumbar hyperextension. EMG showed continued muscular activity in the left leg. Serum antiglutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GAD) titters were high (46U/ml). Tetanus and paraneoplastic syndrome were discarded. The diagnosis of SPS was made and she was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and diazepam with very significant improvement. Conclusion(s): We report a SPS case with focal limb onset, asymmetric progression to other limbs, and minor axial involvement. Such atypical presentations can further delay SPS's recognition. Symptoms' triggers may be key-points for diagnosis, along with a high degree of clinical suspicion.

AB  - Background and aims: Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neuroimmunologic, sometimes paraneoplastic neuromuscular disorder. Here we present a case in order to highlight the difficulties of long-term treatment of SPS in order to ensure the patient's quality of life due to the wide range of side effects and complications of therapies and complications of the disease itself. Method(s): Here we report a case of a 25-year-old Japanese female whose symptoms started at the age of 20 years as rapidly progrediating muscle twitches and cramps. According to the clinical picture, electrophysiological characteristics, cerebrospinal fluid and serum autoantibody results (anti-GAD65 positivity), "classic SPS" has been diagnosed. Hashimoto thyreoiditis has also been detected. 3 months later the patient had to be intubated due to respiratory insufficiency. Then she needed ventilatory support though receiving high dose methylprednisolone, mitoxantrone, intrathecal baclofen. Pneumonia, paralytic ileus, Clostridium difficile infection and thrombocytopenia developed meanwhile. Afterwards she underwent plasma exchange, followed by intravenous immunoglobulin treatment. Result(s): 13 months after the presenting symptoms, spasm of the facial muscles and nystagmus developed, raising the possibility of "progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM)". The patient became respiratordependent for 5 months again. After regularly receiving steroids and IVIG she suffered leukopenia, sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). After the resolution of all of these side effects, the patient became in a relatively good general condition, became a university student. Conclusion(s): The current treatment (azathioprine, dimethyl fumarate, methotrexate, IVIG, baclofen, diazepam, gabapentin) needs regular follow-up in order to prevent further deterioration in SPS and side-effects.

AB  - Objective: Two case reports of Stiff person syndrome (SPS) and SPS variant- Stiff limb syndrome. Background(s): Stiff person syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder of central nervous system characterized by progressive rigidity of axial and limb muscles and episodic painful spasms. SPS can be classified into classic SPS, paraneoplastic SPS and its variants- e.g. Stiff limb syndrome. Diagnostic criteria are based on typical clinical signs and EMG findings showing contionuous motor unit activity at rest. In most cases antibodies against acid decarboxylase (GAD) are observed. Treatment is symptomatic using drugs that enhance GABA transimission and immnodomudulatory therapy. Method(s): Recommended guidelines for SPS therapy with use of symptomatic treatment and immunomodulatory therapy. Result(s): Two case report: Patient 1 is a 41 year old patient with classis SPS. The paraneoplastic etiology in this patient was ruled out, also there was no evidence for any autoimmune disorder. Symptomatic therapy with baclofen (3x25mg) and diazepam (3x5mg), following with 5 sessions of plasma exchange showed no benefit. Afterwards he was treated with IVIG (0,4g/kg/day given over 5 days) with significant improvement lasting 7 months when treatment with IVIG was repeated. Eventually we started chronic immunosuppresive treatment with azathioprine (100mg/d) and methylprednisolone (16mg/d). Treatment is well tolerated, patient is with no significant disability. Patient 2 is a 52 year old woman treated for Hashimoto's thyroiditis, diagnosed with SPS variant- Stiff limb syndrome affected her right upper limb. The symptomatic therapy with baclofen (30mg/d) and diazepam (3x5mg) was not tolerated, plasma exchange showed no benefit. We started treatment with IVIG (0,4g/kg/day given over 5 days) with significant benefit. Afterwards we started chronic treatment with azathioprine (100mg/d) and methylprednisolone (16mg/d). Treatment is well tolerated with good clinical benefit with no need to repeat IVIG therapy. Conclusion(s): SPS is a rare disorder, often misdiagnosed, highly heterogeneous in its manifestation. If left untretaded it could lead to serious disability or eventually to death. Treatment is difficult and change from case to case.

AB  - Objective: To report and discuss three cases of Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) with distinguished clinical features. Background(s): SPS is a rare disorder characterised by progressive fluctuating muscular rigidity and spasm, variable in distribution and severeness. Classical cases have antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), but paraneoplastic cases may have different antibodies. Treatment consists of GABAergic drugs and immunomodulatory agents (Mince et al., 2002). Method(s): Case report. Result(s): A 21-year-old men presented with left foot pain and within days developed progressive stiffness of lower limbs, abdominal and thoracolumbar muscles, painful spasms, exaggerated startle reflex, becoming bedridden in 2 weeks. He had rhabdomyolysis as complication and mild autonomic dysfunction. After 4 months of treatment with diazepam, baclofen, methylprednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and azathioprine the patient showed complete improvement of symptoms. A 33-year-old female had a 3-year history of back-hips-legs stiffness, painful spasms and exaggerated startle reflex and became restricted to a wheelchair after 6 months. Meanwhile, she developed anxiety disorder, diabetes mellitus type 1, Hashimoto's thyroiditis and had spontaneous fracture of the femoral neck, treated with hip arthroplasty. After admission to our hospital, she was prescribed diazepam, baclofen and IVIg and was discharged with azathioprine with partial improvement of the stiffness, without further spasms, being able to walk with assistance. An 80-year-old female was admitted after a 4-year history of falls due to stiffness of the lower limbs, painful spasms and exaggerated startle reflex. Stiffness partially improved, spasms ceased, but the patient remained wheelchair-bound, after repeated IVIg and continuous use of clonazepam and baclofen. Exams, clinical features and treatment are shown in the table below: Conclusion(s): SPS is a rare condition and may present with variable clinical features, evolution and response to treatment, as described in our patients. Patient 2 had a classical syndrome, as it was a female with insidious onset anti-GAD antibodies. Patient 1 was an atypical case because it was a male with sudden onset of symptoms and a complete recovery in the short-term. None of the most common antibodies were detected in patient 3 and response to therapy was suboptimal, therefore a paraneoplastic syndrome has been considered, though not yet confirmed, in this case.

AB  - Background: Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is characterized by progressive rigidity and muscle spasms. SPS is supposed to be an autoimmune disorder as most patients have antibodies directed against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), the rate-limiting enzyme for the production of the inhibitory neurotransmitter c-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Immunodeficiency has never been reported as a feature of SPS. Method(s): We present a 73 year old female suspected SPS with a history of recurrent infections and hypogammaglobulinaemia. Flow cytometry of lymphocyte subpopulations and genetic analysis were performed. Result(s): She is a 73 year old patient whom the diagnosis SPS was made at the age of 56 based on typical clinical features including muscle spasms and fasciculation, typical electromyography pattern and cardiac arrhythmias. Serum analysis revealed typically anti-GAD65 antibodies and a negative test for voltage-gated potassium channel and GABA-receptor antibodies. She also developed recurrent skin malignancies. She had a history of liver hamartomas and a congenital gastro-intestinal malrotation. Her recurrent infections started at the age of 56 with a systemic toxoplasmosis and recurrent respiratory infections. At the age of 66 the diagnosis of Common variable immunodeficiency was made. Rituximab was started later as a treatment for SPS. Laboratory investigations revealed undetectable B lymphocytes and plasma cells in both peripheral blood and bone marrow 4 years after rituximab therapy. T cell counts were 0.5 x 109/l (0.7-2.1 x 109/l), CD8+ T cells were 0.3 x 109/l (0.2-1.2 x 109/l). Naive, memory and effector CD8+ cells were 69%, 23%, 8% of CD8+ T cell subset respectively. CD4+ T cells were 0.2 x 109/l (0.3- 1.4 x 109/l). Naive, memory and effector CD4+ cells were 50, 38, 12% of CD4+ T cell subset respectively. CD16 + 56 + CD3- NK cells were 0.21 x 109/l (0.1-0.5 x 109/l). Functional immunological analysis and exome sequencing are ongoing. Genetic analysis showed a 704 kb duplication in band 7q31.32, this duplication includes TAS2R16, SLC13A1 and exomes of CADPS2. The role of this duplication is unclear. Because of the combination hamartoma and hypogammaglobulinaemia PTEN was sequenced, however no variants were found. The PI3 kinase gene revealed no variants as well. Conclusion(s): We describe for the first time a patient with Stiff person syndrome and immunodeficiency, combined with gastrointestinal malrotation and hamartomas suggesting a yet non-detected gene variant.

AB  - Case/Program Description: The patient is a 47-year-old woman with history of breast cancer status post left mastectomy and chemotherapy who developed significant spasms secondary to stiff person syndrome. She has been hospitalized multiple times for exacerbations and is treated with IVIG with good results. She has been discharged with diazepam, methadone and baclofen on outpatient basis. On her last hospitalization patient has developed recurrent spasms and severe hip pain. She subsequently developed bilateral hip fractures and was treated with total hip arthroplasty. Setting(s): Tertiary care hospital. Result(s): Four months after the bilateral total hip arthroplasty the patient maintained significant hip pain and spasms despite treatment with diazepam, methadone and baclofen, which decreased her participation in therapies. Discussion(s): This is the first reported case, to our knowledge, of bilateral hip fractures in a female with stiff person syndrome related spasms despite generally accepted therapy. Conclusion(s): Even with widely accepted therapy with diazepam and baclofen in patients with stiff person syndrome, refractory spasms may contribute to significant forces exerted on bony elements leading to fractures.

AB  - Case/Program Description: The patient presented after months of progressive gait instability and low back pain that was initially attributed to SI joint pathology and lumbar radiculopathy. He then developed dysarthria, dysphagia, vision impairment and vertigo. On hospital admission, his exam was notable for truncal rigidity, mixed spastic and ataxic dysarthria, left sided ataxia, and ataxic gait. There was no associated weakness or sensory loss. Further work up revealed an elevated glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody level consistent with GAD-Ab Cerebellar Ataxia and painful spasms associated with Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS). The patient was treated with IVIG, diazepam, and baclofen with noted improvement. He was then admitted to the inpatient rehabilitation unit and participated in a comprehensive therapy program. Over a 2-week period his rehabilitation became progressively limited by worsening trunk stiffness, limb spasticity, pain, ataxia, and dysarthria. The patient's progressive functional decline required transfer for further neurological intervention and plasmapheresis. Setting(s): Acute inpatient rehabilitation in an academic tertiary care hospital. Result(s): Despite 2 weeks of comprehensive rehabilitation the patient was unable to make functional gains (Functional Independence Measure of 21 on admission and 20 on discharge). He had worsening symptom severity, increasing discomfort, decreased participation in therapies, and required transfer from the rehab unit. Discussion(s): SPS is a rare neurological condition with variable response to modern treatments. The variant of SPS with GAD-Ab Cerebellar Ataxia is even more unusual, and creates additional challenges for successful rehabilitation. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case that evaluates this SPS variant in the acute rehabilitation setting. Conclusion(s): The presence of GAD-Ab cerebellar ataxia further complicates the acute rehabilitation potential of a patient with SPS. Additional study is required to better understand the optimal time and role of rehabilitation in care of these individuals.

AB  - Case/Program Description: Patient is a 53-year-old man with waxing and waning symptoms of low back pain and leg cramps. Patient noted localized and symmetric stiffness in his quadriceps, hamstrings, and adductors bilaterally. Tightness is associated with pain and decreased range of motion (ROM). This resulted in impaired ambulation, transfers, and balance with frequent associated falls. Physical exam noted bilateral spasticity rated at 2/4 on Modified Ashworth Scale in bilateral hip flexors, adductors, and knee extensors; 4/4 in hamstrings. After extensive workup for stated symptoms, patient was found to have elevated anti-GAD antibodies (>250 in 2009) and was diagnosed with SPS. Patient was initially treated with IVIG and went into remission for several years. In 2012, aforementioned symptoms returned. He subsequently received a course of PLEX and Rituximab x2. Since 2012, patient has been receiving IVIG 1mg/kg divided over 2 days every 4 weeks. In addition to monthly IVIG, patient has tried warm baths, heating pads, TENS unit, corticosteroids, and chiropractor care over several years without any relief in stiffness. His medication management includes baclofen, diazepam, and gabapentin without significant relief in pain nor rigidity. Setting(s): Tertiary Care Hospital. Result(s): After bilateral treatment with botulinum toxin injections to the long head of biceps femoris, adductor magnus, and rectus femoris patient noted significant pain relief, decreased stiffness, and improved ROM. He subsequently endorsed fewer falls, increased distance for ambulation, and improved balance and gait mechanics. Discussion(s): Stiff-Person-Syndrome is an uncommon autoimmune process characterized by progressive axial muscle stiffness, rigidity, and spasms resulting in severely impaired ambulation. This syndrome is commonly associated with anti-GAD antibodies. Traditional treatment includes use of benzodiazepines, baclofen, muscle relaxants, glucocorticoids, IVIG, and plasma exchange. In refractory cases, botulinum toxin can be an adjunct therapy that can improve symptoms. Conclusion(s): Use of botulinum toxin in refractory symptoms for SPS can improve overall function with improved pain control, gait mechanics, and balance.

AB  - Case/Program Description: A 48-year-old woman had initial symptoms of intermittent sharp lumbar pain radiating down bilateral legs, that was unresponsive to various analgesics. This progressed to weakness, spasticity, and immobility. After 3 years, she presented with worsening leg pain, episodic spasms, and frequent falls. On physical examination she had increased tone and reflexes of the bilateral lower extremities. She was admitted to the hospital because of unremitting debilitating pain. Setting(s): Major urban county hospital. Result(s): MRI of the spine and brain were grossly benign. Lack of significant radiographic or laboratory findings suggested an autoimmune, paraneoplastic, myelopathic, or psychiatric etiology. She was given trials of gabapentin, intravenous morphine, and baclofen without any significant relief. This lack of response prompted a suspicion of stiff person syndrome (SPS). A trial of diazepam ultimately led to improvement of symptoms and increased mobility. She was found to be positive for anti-GAD-65 antibodies, which is specific for SPS, helping to establish the diagnosis. Discussion(s): SPS is a rare neuromuscular disease characterized by baseline muscular rigidity with superimposed episodes of spasms. Axial musculature is affected first with extension to the proximal limbs resulting in impaired ambulation. The estimated prevalence is 1:1,000,000, although this is likely due to underdiagnosis. Average ages of symptom onset and diagnosis are 35 and 41.2 years, respectively. Significant impairment due to disease progression may be prevented with earlier diagnosis. Recognizing the signs and symptoms, as well as subsequently ordering appropriate laboratory studies and neuromuscular analyses can help to solidify this elusive diagnosis. Conclusion(s): Currently there is an average delay of 6.2 years between symptom onset and diagnosis of SPS. Education of healthcare providers about rare conditions will help to have disorders such as SPS in the differential, which will yield more timely diagnosis and treatment, and thus better prognosis and quality of life for affected patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune neurological disorder characterized by painful muscle spasms and rigidity. It may be seen in association with other autoimmune diseases, and 60% of patients have anti-glutaminic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies. There are limited reports of patients experiencing significant improvement of their symptoms following a thymectomy. We report on 2 patients with SPS who underwent thymectomies at our institution. CASE PRESENTATION: A 39-year-old lady presented with frequent falls associated with lower back pain and stiffness of her lower limbs which led to difficulties with ambulation. A diagnosis of SPS was made based on her symptoms, an electromyogram (EMG) showing continuous motor unit activity and elevated anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody levels. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax revealed a large well-circumscribed mediastinal mass (Fig.1 and 2), which was confirmed to be a thymoma after percutaneous biopsy. She underwent surgical resection of the mass and histopathology revealed a Modified Masaoka Stage IIa type B1 thymoma. Post operatively, she made an uneventful recovery and was able to ambulate independently with a walking frame on discharge. Our second patient was a 54-year-old ophthalmologist who presented with intermittent episodes of myoclonic jerks of her trunk, worsened by stress and auditory or tactile stimuli with elevated anti-GAD antibody levels. CT thorax revealed a hyperdense heterogeneity in the anterior superior mediastinal region. She underwent surgery and histopathology showed thymic tissue with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia. Her symptoms improved post-operatively and she was able to resume work. DISCUSSION: SPS associated with thymic abnormalities occurs more frequently in females (66%), and mean age of diagnosis was 55 years. Currently, there are 7 reported cases worldwide of SPS associated with thymoma, with patients reporting a significant improvement of symptoms following thymectomy. Most were World Health Organisation (WHO) type B1/B2 thymomas, with one AB and one invasive carcinoma. Five of the 7 cases had elevated anti-GAD antibody levels, which dropped significantly post-thymectomy. Symptom recurrence occurred spontaneously or following tactile stimuli in 3 of these cases. This was successfully controlled with pyridostigmine, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or plasmapheresis. All patients remained symptom free on long term follow up. CONCLUSION(S): In conclusion, limited reports suggest that thymectomy can be effective for relieving symptoms of SPS and should be strongly considered when thymomas are discovered in association with this condition. However, all patients should be counselled that symptoms may recur in future and thus remain on long-term follow up with a neurologist.

AB  - Introduction: Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) is typified by weakness, areflexia and elevated CSF protein. We present a unique case with severe pain, opisthotonos and positive antiglutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies, raising the possibility of concurrent stiff person syndrome (SPS). Case: A previously healthy 17 month old developed lethargy and reluctance to sit or weight bear. He was coryzal but afeb- rile. MRI brain and spine, serum inflammatory markers and CSF results were all unremarkable. His symptoms then evolved to severe pain on truncal flexion with areflexia but no significant weakness. Whole body MRI, septic, neurometabolic and vasculitis screening were negative. Week three CSF showed raised protein and positive oligoclonal bands. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was given but he worsened with extreme irritability and severe opisthotonos. Repeat MRI brain and spine showed no new changes. Nerve conduction studies confirmed sensory motor demyelinating polyneuropathy consistent with GBS. GAD autoantibody levels were significantly elevated. He improved after a second dose of IVIG alongside multimodal analgesia and rehabilitation. He was discharged 6 weeks later pain free and weight bearing. Discussion(s): Opisthotonos is well reported in tetanus, brainstem lesions and advanced meningitis but is poorly described in GBS. Although other features including neurophysiology may point towards a demyelinating polyneuropathy, an additional diagnosis should be considered when opisthotonus is present. SPS is an autoimmune condition characterised by muscle stiffness, painful muscle spasms and GAD autoantibody positivity. Axial forms can present as opisthotonos and positive oligoclonal bands are reported to be a feature. SPS is associated with other autoimmune disorders such as diabetes mellitus and thyrotoxicosis, although its association with GBS has not previously been described in literature. Conclusion(s): SPS should be considered when a child is found to have a diagnosis which does not clearly explain opisthotonus. Anti-GAD antibody levels should be measured in this instance.

AB  - Objective: Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by progressive rigidity and generalized muscle stiffness caused by loss of GABA-ergic inhibition. Diffuse impairment of the GABA-system can be observed by neurophysiological methods. We investigated intracortical and spinal inhibition and correlate these findings with clinical status. Method(s): Fifty-one years old male with a two years history of stiffness and muscle spasms was investigated in our department. Subsequently, we performed EMG, paired TMS and cortical (CoSP) and spinal (CSP) silent periods. Result(s): The patient had 50 times higher serum level of anti-GAD. He suffered from severe lumbar hyperlodosis, hypertrophy of axial muscles, and slightly asymmetrical generalized stiffness more pronounced on the left extremities. EMG discovered continuous involuntary muscle activity. Intracortical short-time inhibition (ICSI) after TMS stimulation was abnormal while stimulated both hemisphere and was more pronounced from the left APB muscle. CoSP and CSP were both abnormally shortened with more shortening when recorded from the left side. Conclusion(s): Our findings confirmed loss of GABA-ergic inhibition in SPS. Involvement of both GABA-A and GABA-B inhibitory circuit systems are present with makeable left-side asymmetry corresponding to clinical status.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurologic disorder characterized by waxing and waning muscular rigidity, stiffness and spasms. Three subtypes have been described: paraneoplastic, autoimmune and idiopathic. Rhabdomyolysis has been described in the paraneoplastic variant, but to our knowledge no case has been reported involving the autoimmune variant. We report a case report of a 50-year-old man with history of SPS who presented with recurrent episodes of severe limb and back spasms. He was hospitalized on two separate occasions for uncontrollable spasms associated with renal failure and creatinine phosphokinase elevations of 55,000 and 22,000 U/L respectively. Laboratory tests were otherwise unremarkable. The acute renal failure resolved during both admissions with supportive management. Rhabdomyolysis has the potential to be fatal and early diagnosis is essential. It should be considered in patients who have SPS and are experiencing an exacerbation of their neurologic condition.Copyright © S. Gangadhara et al., 2016.

AB  - Antibodies to GAD-65 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes , limbic encephalitis and Stiff person syndrome, however these diseases rarely occur concurrently. We intend to present a rare case of 35 year old female who was recently diagnosed as having type 1 diabetes presented with 1 month history of recurrent seizures, subacute onset gait ataxia, dysathria, psychiatric disturbance and cognitive decline. No tumor was found on imaging and the classic paraneoplastic panel was negative. Cerebrospinal fluid and blood was positive for GAD-65 antibodies.Patient showed significant improvement with immunomodulatory therapy. Association of GAD-65 antibodies has been found with various disorders including type 1 diabetes, limbic encephalitis, Stiff person syndrome,cerebellar ataxia and palatal myoclonus.This case presents with unique combination of type 1 diabetes, Stiff person syndrome and limbic encephalitis associated with GAD-65 antibodies that is responsive to immunotherapy. It also highlights the emerging concept of autoimmunity in the causation of various disorders and there associations.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology  Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.

AB  - The stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune neurologic disorder that affects the gamma-ami-nobutyric acid (GABA) mediated inhibitory network in the central nervous system with anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies. SPS is characterized by muscle rigidity and painful episodic spasms in axial and lower limb muscles. This case report describes successful peri-operative management of a 61-year-old female (height 158 cm ; weight 60 kg, ASA-PS 2) with her right upper arm fracture who was scheduled for open reduction and internal fixation. This patient had bulbar paralysis, dysphagia and muscle rigidity associated with a high titer of anti-GAD auto antibodies (2,800 U . ml-1). She was diagnosed as SPS and has been treated with predonisolone (30 mg . day-1) and diazepam (20 mg . day-1) for 1 year. Predonisolone (15 mg) and diazepam (30 mg) was given orally before induction of general anesthesia with propofol, remifentanil and rocuronium bromide. Posture change from supine to beach-chair position led to sudden drop in blood pressure to 38/25 mmHg, which recovered promptly by injecting intravenous ephedrine hydrochloride (28 mg) and hydrocortisone (100 mg). Postanesthetic course was uneventful without postoperative neurologic abnormalities.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is an autoimmune neuronitis with progressive myoclonus and stiffness. It is a rare but treatable disorder with few case reports in children. SPS is due to autoantibodies against the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase which is present in neuronal and nonneuronal tissues. This is the case report of an 8-year-old boy with clinical and investigational features suggestive of SPS with associated myoglobin-induced renal failure, who completely recovered with treatment.

AB  - Objective: We present the case and videos of a boy with severe stimulus sensitive spasms primarily affecting the face, and associated with glycine receptor antibodies (GlyR-Ab) tested at the Nuffield neuroimmunology laboratory, Oxford using immunofluorescence cell-based assay. Case report: A 4 year old boy presented with facial asymmetry, confusion, arm and leg rigidity, and intermittent severe stimulus sensitive dystonic spasms of the limbs and mouth initially diagnosed as trismus; predated by 3 weeks of mandibular spasms whilst eating (Video 1). Clinical examination revealed hyperekplexia (Video 2). Initial CSF analysis and neuroimaging were normal. The dystonic episodes worsened despite clonidine and benzodiazepines, and he required PICU admission due to severe facial spasms. EEG showed encephalopathy, repeat neuroimaging was unremarkable and an ultrasound excluded neoplasia. He was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG;2 g/kg), and after infective aetiology was excluded, antibiotics were discontinued and he received high dose methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day for 5 days) followed by oral prednisolone. He dramatically improved (Video 3) over the following 2 weeks, and was discharged on maintenance oral steroids (2 mg/kg/ day). GlyR-Ab were detected in the serum and oligoclonal bands in the CSF. Discussion(s): Stiff person syndrome is a spectrum of disorders characterised by spinal cord hyperexcitability, with rigidity primarily of the lower limbs and trunk, stimulus-sensitive spasms, myoclonus, autonomic dysfunction and hyperekplexia. Its more severe variant, progressive encephalitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM), is characterised by more widespread features including brainstem involvement or sensory symptoms, and GlyR-Ab have been identified in these patients (Carvajal-Gonzalez et al., Brain,2014;137(Pt 8):2178-92). The detection of GlyR-Ab presents the possibility that, in common with other antibody-associated conditions, PERM is amenable to immunotherapy. Conclusion(s): We present, to our knowledge, the first case of stimulus sensitive spasms affecting primarily the face, and propose that "Stiff face syndrome" is an important feature of this under-recognised and treatable syndrome.

AB  - Objectives: We present a unique case of glycine receptor antibody (GlyR-Ab) mediated progressive encephalomyelitis associated with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) in a child with autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 (APS1), initially masquerading as ocular myasthenia gravis. Method(s): Retrospective review of patient notes and relevant literature search. Result(s): A 15 year-old boy, with genetically confirmed APS1 (with several autoimmune conditions from the age of 7 years: hypoparathyroidism, type 1 diabetes, Addison's disease and alopecia), presented with acute onset variable bilateral ptosis and diplopia, worse on waking. On examination he had bilateral incomplete ptosis, horizontal and vertical nystagmus with left lateral gaze palsy. A diagnosis of ocular myasthenia gravis was suspected, however, tensilon test, single-fibre EMG and repetitive nerve stimulation, acetylcholine receptor and MUSK antibodies were negative. MRI brain and spine were normal. A trial of pyridostigmine was ineffectual. Two months later, he started experiencing skin itching, stiff neck, mild bulbar symptoms, and bladder and bowel difficulties. Further review revealed decreased palatal and tongue movements, neck rigidity, dysarthria, and very brisk deep tendon reflexes with normal plantar response. Myoclonic jerks were elicited on tactile stimulation, particularly in the face. There were no other abnormal neurological signs. Due to the clinical features constellation, a diagnosis of a GlyR-Ab-associated pathology deemed very likely. Subsequently, serum and cerebrospinal fluid GlyR-Abs were positive, with no evidence of other neuronal surface antibodies. A 5-day course of IVIG improved partially ocular manifestations, and, more significantly, myoclonus, neck rigidity, bulbar dysfunction and urinary urgency. Conclusion(s): (1) PERM associated with GlyR Abs has been well described, especially in adult population, whereas it is very rare in paediatrics. (2) As in adult cases, clinical presentations with eye signs may mimic ocular myasthenia. (3) PERM may be added to the list of the autoimmune manifestations associated with APS1.

AB  - Objective: To assess structural and functional changes in the afferent visual system of patients with Stiff-Person Syndrome (SPS). Background(s): SPS is a rare neuroimmunological disorder characterized by progressive rigidity and painful muscle spasms. The majority of patients exhibit autoantibodies directed against glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD); a ubiquitous enzyme found throughout the nervous system. SPS patients often have visual complaints which are commonly overlooked/under-recognized and therefore have not been evaluated in SPS. Design/Methods: Forty SPS patients and matched healthy controls underwent Cirrus HD-OCT, and a subset of 30 patients and matched controls underwent 100%, 2.5% and 1.25%-contrast letter-acuity testing. An automatic macular segmentation method was used to compute the combined thickness of the ganglion cell+inner plexiform layer (GCIP). Mixed effects linear regression models were used to investigate whether retinal layer thicknesses and visual function differed between SPS and controls. AAN.COM Results: The SPS cohort was slightly older than controls, although not significantly (mean difference=3 years; p=0.17), and had a mean modified Rankin scale of 2.0 (SD=0.66). Adjusting for age and a history of diabetes, the mean retinal thickness values were significantly lower in the SPS cohort (mean difference=5.1 urn; p=0.004), which appears to be driven by a thinned GCIP layer thickness (mean difference=1.9 urn; p=0.012). SPS patients exhibited lower visual acuity on 100%, 2.5% and 1.25% contrast letter-acuity charts (mean difference=4.3 letters, 5.8 letters and 5.0 letters; p=0.002, p=0.009 and p=0.031, respectively). Moreover, SPS patients without a history of diabetes exhibited significantly thinner GCIP layer thicknesses (p=0.05), and significantly worse visual acuity on high contrast, 2.5% contrast and 1.25% contrast charts (mean differences= 6.2, 6.4 and 5.4 letters; p=0.001, p=0.003, p=0.026, respectively) compared to controls. Conclusion(s): SPS patients have mild visual dysfunction compared to healthy controls, as well as thinned GCIP layers. These findings suggest that SPS may cause retinal neuronal pathology, possibly resulting from an autoimmune retinopathy.

AB  - Objective: To characterize the utility and yield of glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (anti-GAD65) testing and to analyze the associated diagnoses, management, and prognosis in seropositive patients. Background(s): Anti-GAD65 antibodies are associated with a spectrum of neurological syndromes and diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1). Prior research suggests that anti-GAD65 at high titers are highly specific for stiff-person syndrome (SPS) and cerebellar ataxia (CA). Design/Methods: Retrospective review of anti-GAD65 tests ordered between January 2007 and July 2015 at a tertiary care center. Anti-GAD65 titers were classified as low (<1:600 or <20 nmol/L) or high (>1:1200 or >20 nmol/L). For the seropositive patients we collected demographics, medical history, presenting symptoms, clinical course, clinician's preliminary and final diagnosis, relevant laboratory evaluations, EEG, neuroimaging, management, and prognosis. Result(s): A total of 403 patients were evaluated, of whom 37 (9%) were found to be anti-GAD65 positive (age 9-81 years, 20 women). Five patients had high anti-GAD65 titers. Each of the 5 patients had a different diagnosis: SPS, CA with stiff-limb syndrome, steroid-responsive encephalopathy dominated by behavioral abnormalities, DM1, and mild parkinsonism with saccadic intrusions. Of the 32 patients with low anti-GAD65 titers, 4 had a neurological syndrome associated with another anti-neuronal antibody (anti-NMDAR, anti-Hu, anti-VGKC, and anti-amphiphysin), one had limbic encephalitis, one had steroid-responsive encephalopathy with associated thyroiditis [thyroid peroxidase antibody >1000 lU/mL (ref. <35 IU/mL)], one had Sjogren syndrome-associated neuronopathy, 4 had primary or secondary CNS malignancy, 8 had DM1, and 13 had non-inflammatory neurological conditions. A new malignancy was diagnosed only in the 2 patients with anti-Hu and anti-amphiphysin antibodies. Conclusion(s): Anti-GAD65 antibody-associated neurological syndromes are rare. Only 3 of the 5 patients with high-titer anti-GAD65 had a related autoimmune neurological disorder.

AB  - Objective: Tactile startle is an uncommon manifestation that localizes to the brainstem. It occurs in pediatric epileptic patients predominantly, but can occur in adults with brainstem disease such as infection, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. Our patient presented with multiple cranial neuropathies and an exaggerated tactile startle response. Background(s): N/A Design/Methods: A 75-year-old man with a remote history of carcinoid lung cancer, and renal cell carcinoma, presented with progressive dysphagia, dysarthria and alternating facial weakness for about 2 weeks. He noticed abnormal tongue sensation and dysarthria. A video swallowing study demonstrated oropharyngeal dysphagia. He had progressive fatigue, left facial dysesthesia, and frequent brisk startle responses to facial stimulation. He had no fever or weight loss. He developed episodes of tachypnea with oxygen desaturation, episodes of tachycardia-bradycardia, then a cardiac arrest responding to CPR. Subsequently, he developed ophthalmoplegia, pyramidal extremity weakness, transient hyponatremia responding to fluid restriction, and then stiffness in his lower limbs. Contrasted brain MRI, LP with cytology and flow cytometry, paraneoplastic panel, and HIV testing were negative. Sedimentation rate 78, C-reactive protein 23.3, and serum protein electrophoresis detected monoclonal bands IgG Lambda type. PET scan demonstrated focal mediastinal lymph nodes uptake. Bronchoscopy with biopsy confirmed small cell lung carcinoma. He received IVIG and high-dose steroids with no response. He began chemotherapy with a plan for radiation of the abnormal mediastinal glands. Result(s): N/A Conclusion(s): The spectrum of paraneoplastic disorders, particularly affecting the nervous system, is expanding rapidly with the discovery of new antibodies. Because the sensitivity of paraneoplastic antibody testing is low (sensitivity 34%, specificity 86%) neurologists must be aware of, and be vigilant for, such syndromes that often require total body imaging to uncover the offending neoplasm.

AB  - Objective: We report two patients who were diagnosed with stiff person syndrome (SPS) after several years of other neurological symptoms. In each case, prior antibody testing was repeatedly negative. Patient 1 developed high-titer glutamic acid decarboxylase-65 (GAD65) antibodies many years subsequent to symptom onset. Patient 2 had a multi-year evolution of visual and neurologic symptoms and was ultimately found to have glycine receptor (GlyR) antibodies after the advent of testing. Background(s): SPS is a rare neurological disorder characterized by progressive muscle stiffness and painful spasms. Several variants of SPS have been described, representing a spectrum of severity, ranging from symptoms in only one limb to progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity, myoclonus or other symptoms. Known antibodies associated with SPS spectrum disorder include GAD65 and GlyR. Design/Methods: Case series and literature review. Result(s): Patient 1 is a 50 year old male with a progressive 16 year history of neck and shoulder muscle spasms, pain, and several episodes of cramping daily. Patient 2 is a 50 year old female with 13 years of visual distortions and subsequent progression to cognitive symptoms, epilepsy and muscle spasms. Both patients were followed for several years prior to the onset of a classical SPS phenotype. Patient 1 had a slow but dramatic increase in GAD65 antibody (GlyR negative) over the recent 2 year period. Patient 2 was found to have GlyR antibody positivity (GAD65 negative). Conclusion(s): This case series underscores the importance of documenting objective abnormalities and maintaining long-term monitoring in patients with suspected SPS spectrum disorder, especially seronegative patients. SPS patients can present with seemingly atypical symptoms prior to the onset of the classical phenotype. The seronegative SPS population is especially at risk of misdiagnosis and under treatment, and seronegative patients should be retested periodically for the presence of newly discovered antibodies.

AB  - Objective: To report our experience with an in-house developed cell-based assay for IgG antibody targeting the alpha-1 subunit of glycine receptor (GlyRa1) among patients and control subjects. Background(s): GlyRa1antibody is a biomarker of spinal and brainstem hyperexcitability (stiff-person spectrum [SPS] disorders) which includes classical SPS, limited SPS (e.g. stiff-limb), progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) and hyperekplexia. Design/Methods: HEK293 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding GlyRa1subunit or were non-transfected and exposed to serum or CSF. Patients (n=20) were GlyRa1antibody positive from physician requests (2013-2016). Controls (n=240 total) were subjects with serum (n=190: 100 healthy adults; 40 healthy children; 50 patients with nonorgan specific immunopathies) or CSF (n=50: 30 adults with normal pressure hydrocephalus; 20 children with hereditary neurological disorders). Result(s): GlyRa1 antibody positivity was found in none of the CSF controls and 8 of 190 serum controls (4%: 5 healthy, 2 with polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia and 1 with SLE). Of the 20 patients, 1 had a functional neurological disorder (GlyRa1 antibody positive in serum only). The remaining 19 patients had organic SPS spectrum disorders. Ten were male, median age of symptom onset was 51 years. Six patients had GAD65 antibody coexisting (median value: 60.2 nmol/L; range, 0.04-3861). GlyRa1-IgG was detected in serum in 18/19 patients (3/11 were also positive in CSF) and in CSF alone in 1 patient. Phenotypes included PERM (8), SPS (5), stiff-limb (5), and hyperekplexia (1). Neuropsychiatric symptoms (anxiety only [10], anxiety and depression [5], and cognitive dysfunction [3]) coincided with SPS symptoms in 50% of patients. Neoplasms were identified in 4 patients: thymoma (2); Hodgkin lymphoma (1) and ovarian adenocarcinoma (1). Objective neurologic improvement occurred in 15/17 immunotherapy-treated patients (88%), although 2 with PERM died. Conclusion(s): In the context of SPS spectrum disorders, GlyRa1antibody is a biomarker of an immunotherapy- responsive neurological disease.

AB  - Objective: To report two cases of stiff-person syndrome (SPS) initially presenting as more common movement disorders. Background(s): SPS is a rare disorder characterized by progressive muscle stiffness, spasms, and rigidity that may ultimately result in severe disability. Most cases are caused by antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), with resultant disruption of GABA synthesis and impairment of inhibitory pathways in the central nervous system. Most commonly, cases present with thoracolumbar and abdominal muscle spasms. However, variants are increasingly appreciated, leading to the term "stiff person plus" to span more focal-onset stiff limb syndrome and other more diverse presentations. Design/Methods: Case report Results: We present two cases of SPS that initially presented with features of more common movement disorders. One patient presented with progressive gait difficulty following a GI illness and was noted to have a subtle dystonia of his right hand. His symptoms progressed to generalized parkinsonism, but was unresponsive to levodopa, leading to consideration of a corticobasal syndrome. He developed disabling rigidity with painful paraspinous muscle spasms, rendering him bed bound. Further work-up revealed markedly elevated serum anti-GAD antibody (210; normal< 0.02 nmol/L), and CSF studies revealed 9 oligoclonal bands and elevated IgG index. Another patient initially presented with foot dystonia. She was evaluated for Wilson's disease and treated with onabotulinum toxin injections. In fact, psychogenic etiology was entertained. She continued to worsen and was eventually found to have elevated serum anti-GAD antibody (328; normal<1.0 U/ml) consistent with stiff limb syndrome. Her symptoms gradually generalized and she developed fixed ankle contractures and joint deformities. Conclusion(s): SPS may present with features mimicking more common movement disorders. A high index of suspicion is needed in patients with unusual abnormal tone or movements. More research is needed to understand the inciting factors leading to autoimmunity and the variability in clinical presentation and response to therapies.

AB  - Summary Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a disabling disorder of the central nervous system that is characterized by episodic rigidity and spasticity. We report the case of a woman who had SPS with cerebellar manifestations (SPS-Cer) and asymmetric deformed feet. SPS-Cer is a rare phenotype that has a poor prognosis for improvement of cerebellar function, even after adequate treatment. © 2013, Taiwan Society of Geriatric Emergency & Critical Care Medicine.

AB  - We present a case of 42-year-old woman without significant medical history, admitted in our clinic for painful neck stiffness, aggravated by emotions and stress relieved during sleep, accompanied by sweating, predominantly lower limbs weakness. The symptoms insidiously appeared one month prior presentation. On neurological examination we found painful paravertebral and laterocervical muscle contracture and spastic paraparesis. Laboratory tests included the analysis of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD65) and anti-Borrelia antibodies, carcinoma antigens (CA 125, CA 15-3) which were found negative. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis found positive oligoclonal bands with a slight increase of IgG component. Other tests including thyroid function were found normal. Brain and spinal MRI examinations showed no changes. Methylprednisolone, baclofen and carbamazepine were administered without a significant improvement. After 4 months from the first admission, the patient returns with increased symptoms for which plasma exchange achieved a slight improvement of motor deficit and rigidity. Stiff person syndrome is thought to be triggered by anti-GAD antibodies that limit the GABA receptor activity, although about 10 to 40% of the patients do not shows these antibodies in the serum.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the repertoire of antibodies in a large cohort of patients with GAD65 antibody-associated syndromes. Background(s): High titer antibodies against GAD65 have been described in a variety of disorders, including cerebellar ataxia (CA), stiff-person syndrome (SMS), and limbic encephalitis/seizures (LE). This variety of phenotypes has suggested that differences of GAD65-antibody titers and/or co-existing autoimmunities may be present in these patients. Method(s): 109 patients with GAD65-antibody-associated syndromes (40 CA, 32 SMS and 37 LE cases) were included in the study. The presence of GAD65-antibodies was confirmed with immunohistochemistry of rat cerebellum, and ELISA or a cell-based assay (CBA). GAD67-antibodies were determined by a CBA, and antibodies to neuronal cell-surface antigens were examined with immunofluorescence with cultured hippocampal neurons and antigen-specific CBA (NMDAR, GABAaR, GABAbR, GlyR). Result(s): GAD67-antibodies were identified in 82/109 (75%) patients with anti-GAD65 associated syndromes. There was a correlation between the presence of higher titers of GAD65-antibodies and the presence of GAD67-antibodies (p=0.0054). All clinical phenotypes associated with a similar range of GAD65-antibody titers. In all patients the GAD65-antibodies recognized linear epitopes (visible by immunoblot). Thirteen patients had co-existing cell surface antibodies: 5 GlyR, 5 GABAaR, 1 GABAb receptor, and 1 NMDA receptor. The presence of cell surface antibodies was more frequent in patients with LE (7/37, 19%) compared with patients with CA (4/40, 10%) or SMS (2/32, 6%). Conclusion(s): 75% of patients with GAD65-antibody-associated syndromes have GAD67-antibodies. The association of GAD67-antibodies with LE has not been previously reported. The variety of phenotypes occurring in association with GAD65-antibodies cannot be explained by differences in GAD65-antibody titers (similar range in all phenotypes) or the presence of GAD67-antibodies. In a subset of patients with LE the clinical picture is likely related to coexisting and more relevant antibodies to cell-surface antigens.

AB  - OBJECTIVE:To describe three patients with concurrent Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) and Cerebellar Ataxia (CA) with anti-GAD antibody, which evolved over time.BACKGROUND:Anti-GAD antibodies are associated with SPS and CA. They rarely occur concurrently. MRI findings are usually normal or cerebellar atrophy. IVIG usually improves SPS but treatment for CA is less certain.DESIGN/METHODS:1) 56 year old female diagnosed with SPS at 53, which improved with IVIG. Three years later, she developed unilateral cerebellar tremor, nystagmus and dysarthria. IVIG helped her SPS, but not CA. Rituximab produced improvement in only CA. Initial MRI showed cerebellar T2 abnormality. Repeat MRI showed cerebellar atrophy. Anti-GAD antibody 101.7 U/ml.2) 29 year old female with Graves' disease and pernicious anemia. At 24 she developed gait imbalance and dysarthria and was diagnosed with CA which required no treatment. Five years later, she developed SPS. SPS, but not CA, responded to IVIG. MRI showed cerebellar atrophy. Anti-GAD antibody 113.2 U/ml.3) 27 year old female with intractable seizures at 18 treated with temporal lobectomy. At 24 she had new limb stiffness. One year later, while receiving IVIG, she developed left cerebellar tremor and nystagmus. Her SPS, but not CA, responded to IVIG. MRI showed temporal lobectomy and FLAIR hyperintensity in the left putamen and left frontal region. Anti-GAD antibody 116.2 U/ml. RESULT(S): We describe three patients in whom CA and SPS evolved over time with anti-GAD antibody. Two had cerebellar atrophy and two had nonspecific T2 lesions. All three were treated with IVIG which improved SPS but not CA. One patient received Rituximab with improvement in CA but not SPS. CONCLUSION(S): SPS and CA may occur concurrently and evolve over time in patients with anti-GAD even while on treatment. SPS and CA may respond differentially to IVIG and Rituximab.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the improvement seen after intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy in patients with Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS), an antibody-mediated disease model, is related to shifting epitope recognition of the anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) antibodies.BACKGROUND: IVIg is an effective therapy in patients with SPS based on a placebo-controlled randomized trial (Dalakas et al, NEJM, 2001). SPS patients harbor high-titer antibodies against GAD65, the enzyme that converts glutamic acid into GABA. Previous epitope mapping studies have shown that in SPS patients these antibodies bind predominantly to the enzyme's catalytic domain and inhibit its action.DESIGN/METHODS: An immunoprecipitation assay (LIPS) was used for epitope mapping. Full length and three non-overlapping fragments of GAD65, spanning amino-acids 2-95 (GAD65D1), 96-444 (GAD65D2) and 445-585 (GAD65D3), were cloned next to a luciferase reporter gene (RUC). A sub-fragment of the GAD65D2 domain, spanning amino-acids 221-444 (GAD65D4) more tightly matching the catalytic core was also cloned. After construct transfection into HEK293T cells, extracts containing the RUC-antigen fusions were prepared. Sera from six SPS patients treated with IVIg (1 dose/month for three months) before and after the three-month treatment period, were incubated with extracts and antibody-antigen binding was measured by means of light emission. RESULT(S): 5/6 pre-therapy SPS sera showed highest reactivity against the catalytic epitope fragments GAD65D2 and GAD65D4; one patient's serum showed highest reactivity with fragments GAD65D1 and GAD65D2. The GAD antibody titers decreased after IVIg therapy in 3 of the 6 patients, but no differences in epitope specificity were detected in any of the 6 patients, in spite of good clinical response to IVIg. CONCLUSION(S): In GAD-positive SPS patients, IVIg does not seem to modify the GAD epitope-binding pattern even in those patients who improve after therapy. The study has implications in understanding the mode of action of IVIg in other antibody-mediated neurological conditions.Co-financed by EU and Greek funds; "Education and Lifelong Learning": Thales.

AB  - OBJECTIVE:To assess the overall efficacy of home infused intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) using patient-reported outcomes.BACKGROUND:There is widespread use of IVIG for the treatment of SPS. However there is a dearth of information regarding the efficacy IVIG in SPS in a supervised, home-based setting. Disease modifying therapies for SPS patients are limited, and intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) represents one of the only well-studied therapies available. The goal of this analysis was to collect patient-reported therapy responses as a complement to clinical evaluation, and to assess whether or not these measures are of use in evaluating therapeutic efficacy.DESIGN/METHODS:The efficacy of home based administration of IVIG was longitudinally evaluated in 34 SPS patients from 2008 to 2012 who received approximately 790 IVIG infusions. We collected 276 evaluations performed by home infusion nurses that included patient-reported outcomes. Using a scale of 0-10, arm, trunk and leg stiffness, pain, balance, cramps, heightened sensitivity scale and activities of daily living were evaluated monthly. Subjective response to therapy and side effects were also recorded. RESULT(S):Preliminary analysis of the subjective outcomes data collected indicates that 27% of patients reported improvement, 27% improved then relapsed, 31% were stable, and 8% worsened between infusions. Patient- reported overall response to therapy suggests that 57% were "better", 19% remained the "same", and 13% were "worse" compared to before IVIG treatment. CONCLUSION(S):Patient-reported outcomes are practical tools to assess the efficacy of home infused IVIG in SPS in a relatively large set of patients. Work is in progress to evaluate the safety profile of home infused IVIG in SPS, to determine if there is a correlation between the IVIG regimens and clinical improvement, and to assess correlation between subjective measures and ADLs as documented by patient-reported outcomes.

AB  - Introduction: Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) is a variant of the Stiff Person Syndrome. Associated antibodies are mainly directed against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), glycine receptors (GlyR), or amphiphysin. Here, we report a distinct variant of PERM comprising marked hyperekplexia, cerebellar ataxia, and trunk stiffness who tested negative for the antibodies hitherto described, but positive for a new antibody directed against the dipeptidyl peptidase-like protein 6 (DPPX or DPP6). Method(s): Case series describing the clinical, paraclinical, and serological features of three patients with PERM. A recombinant, cell-based indirect immunofluorescence assay with DPPX-expressing HEK293 cells was used to detect DPPX antibodies in conjunction with mammalian tissues. Result(s): All patients presented with a distinct syndrome involving hyperekplexia, prominent cerebellar ataxia with marked eye movement disorder, and trunk stiffness of variable intensity. Additional symptoms comprised allodynia, neurogenic pruritus, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Symptoms began insidiously and progressed slowly. An inflammatory CSF profile with mild pleocytosis and intrathecal IgG -synthesis was found in all patients. High DPPX antibody titers were detected in the patient's serum and CSF, with specific antibody indices suggestive of intrathecal synthesis of DPPX antibodies. Response to immunotherapy was good, but constant and aggressive treatment may be required. Conclusion(s): These cases highlight the expanding spectrum of both PERM and anti-neuronal antibodies. Testing for DPPX antibodies should be considered in the diagnostic work-up of patients with acquired hyperekplexia, cerebellar ataxia, and stiffness, as such patients might benefit from immunotherapy.

AB  - Introduction: Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare disorder characterized by rigidity of the truncal muscles, painful spasms, and an exquisite sensitivity to external stimuli. Stiff-limb syndrome (SLS) is a rare variant of SPS. We report a SLS in a young woman. Case report: A 27-year-old healthy woman presented with a sudden onset of spasms of right arm muscles, preceded by sudden movement, loud noise or emotional stress. Her physical examination was remarkable in that her right upper extremity was rigid on passive and active ranges of motion. Movements were severely limited and painful. No paraspinal or axial contractions were palpated. Sensory examination was normal, and there was no extrapyramidal rigidity. EMG testing showed continuous motor unit activity on the upper right arm muscles. Anti-GAD antibody examination was negative. Immunological data and the paraneoplastic antibodies were negative. The patient improved at high doses of clonazepam. She was given also IV immunoglobulin as an adjunctive therapy. Discussion(s): SLS is a newly emerging entity presenting focally with rigidity and spasms involving one or more limbs. The distal leg is the most affected. EMG show continuous motor unit activity at rest, but the distribution is very different from SPS. GAD auto-antibody titers are raised in a smaller proportion. SLS can also be paraneoplastic. Response to treatment is partial in SLS in marked contrast with those with SPS. Our patient remains ambulatory. Conclusion(s): Only two cases of SLS exhibiting upper limb signs were reported. Our case report illustrates this exceptional variant of SPS.

AB  - Introduction: Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune neurological disorder characterized by progressive stiffness and painful spasms in the trunk and lower extremities. Little information about physiotherapy management of SPS is found in the literature. The aim of this case report was to show the effects of inpatient physiotherapy management for a patient with SPS. Method(s): The patient was a 65-year-old female with SPS diagnosed one year before. She spent 31 days in hospital. Plasmapheresis sessions were performed 5 times for cerebellar symptoms. Initial assessments were range of motion, muscle strength, pain, balance, coordination, ambulation and function. She got pain in shoulders; visual analogue scale (VAS) was 5. Muscle strength was affected. She had sitting balance, however could not stand up and walk. Her Functional Mobility Profile (FMP) score was 35/63. She received physiotherapy for 14 sessions. It included mainly balance, coordination, posture, strengthening, stretching exercises, and repetitive task training. After gaining standing balance, walking exercises were applied. Result(s): Her coordination and muscle strength was increased. Her pain disappeared (VAS-0). Her static and dynamic balance improved dramatically and she started to walk with a walker at the 9th session. Her walking speed, distance and independence improved. The last FMP score was 49/63 and she could walk 20 meters with a walker without rest. Conclusion(s): Considering plasmapheresis was performed for cerebellar symptoms, it seems that the resulting improvements are caused by physiotherapy. Inpatient physiotherapy management for SPS can be effective to improve function and the impairments associated with SPS.

AB  - Introduction: Stiff-Person Syndrome (SPS) is strongly associated with other autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome (APS) is characterized by the coexistence of at least two glandular autoimmune diseases. Method(s): Case report. Result(s): A 74-year-old female patient with a past history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, atrophic gastritis and depression, presented with an 18-month history of progressive stiffness and gait problems, associated with painful abdominal and lower limb spasms that caused major disability. She had a recent exploratory laparotomy for unexplained abdominal pain, and was admitted due to recurrence of severe abdominal pain and lower limb spasms. Examination revealed a "mask-like" facies, left and right gaze-evoked upbeat nystagmus and partial left gaze paresis; bradykynesia and rigidity of the four limbs, generalized hyperreflexia, a small stepped gait with freezing and retropulsion, and clusters of painful abdominal and lower limb tonic spasms, which were aggravated by tactile stimuli. Neuraxis MRI and CSF examination were unremarkable, and electromyography was normal, although it was made after clinical improvement. Serum GAD-65 antibodies were positive, along with anti-insulin, Langerhans cells, intrinsic factor and thyroid peroxidase antibodies. Investigation for an occult tumor revealed negative. Treatment with diazepam and baclofen improved the muscle spams, and intravenous immunoglobulin improved limb rigidity and gait. Conclusion(s): We report a case of atypical SPS with prominent features of brainstem, cerebellar dysfunction and parkinsonism, and with a distinctive association with multiple autoimmune diseases, comprising APS type 3. This case alerts also for SPS to be considered in the differential diagnosis of atypical parkinsonian syndrome.

AB  - Objective: This case study describes the treatment of Mr A, a patient with Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) whose lower limb stiffening was aggravated severely in public situations by social anxiety. Background(s): SPS is a rare neurological condition, characterised by rigidity in the trunk and limbs. Comorbid anxiety is common in this condition, and is known to exacerbate stiffness. Cognitive behavioural therapy is an effective psychological treatment for anxiety. Method(s): A cognitive-behavioural model was applied to treat this problem, focussing on reducing anxiety and therefore stiffness by addressing rumination, self-focussed attention, and distressing cognitions relating to walking in public. Result(s): Within five weeks of cognitive behavioural therapy, Mr A reported on a Visual Analogue Scale that his stiffening in public situations had reduced from 10/10 to 2/10, his walking in public had improved from 4/10 to 8/10, social anxiety had reduced from 6/10 to 2/10, and self-confidence had risen from 5/10 to 8/10. Unfortunately, while Mr A's social anxiety continued to improve at 5 months follow-up, his neurological condition worsened. Mr A and his Neurologist feel that this deterioration was biological, rather than psychological in nature. Conclusion(s): This is the first published case where SPS has been ameliorated (albeit temporarily) using psychological therapy, and has important implications for future research and treatment.

AB  - Objective: To describe a neurological syndrome in a patient with Anti glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies. Background(s): Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by progressive muscle stiffness, rigidity, and spasm involving the axial muscles, resulting in severely impaired ambulation. Circulating anti-GAD antibodies are present in approximately 60 percent of patients with SPS. There are also reported cases of Anti-GAD presenting with limbic encephalitis. Method(s): Case report. Result(s): We report a case of 58 years old male patient presenting with long standing gait/balance difficulties and Memory problems. His symptoms started approximately 13 years back with short term memory problems, psychiatry problems- with Anxiety, depression, OCD, apathy. 2 years later he started having muscle stiffness, neck and back pain, falls. He ended up having multiple spine surgeries without much improvement. Recently he also started having lightheadedness, nausea, bladder incontinence. On examination he had a flat affect, neck and back stiffness, hyperreflexia left>Right, short term memory problem, no involuntary movements seen. MRIB showed right temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy. DAT scan showed abnormal uptake in striatum. EEG didn't show any epileptiform activity. Autonomic testing shows dysautonomia. Labs showed positive Anti GAD antibodies, low Serum IGG, CSF study showed elevated IGG index and absent oligoclonal bands. Patient was given empiric IVIG with some improvement in his symptoms. Conclusion(s): Although Anti-GAD has been previously reported to present with Stiff person syndrome and Limbic encephalitis with seizure and/or psychiatric symptoms, our patient also reported to have Immunodeficiency, Parkinsonism and Dysautonomia, adding another dimension to Anti-GAD encephalitis.

AB  - Objective: Stiff person syndrome is rare in childhood, mimicking other disorders. We report stiff person syndrome in childhood and review the literature emphazing features of this unusual pediatric movement disorder . Background(s): Stiff person syndrome is rare in childhood. There is a lower incidence of co morbid conditions versus adults. Stiff person has immunologic abnormalities. Anti glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (anti Gad) are detected in 60-80% of patients in the serum or csf. Gabaregic pathways act as inhibitory pathway in spinal interneurons coordinating motor function by inhibition of discharges from spinal neurons. Impairment of gabarergic function leads to continuous firing of spinal neurons with stiffness. Antibodies to GABAA receptor associated protein (GABARAP) inhibit the GABAA rceptor expression leading to receptor instability with immunologic abnormalities. Method(s): An 8 year old female presented with 1 1/2 years of bilateral hamstring tightness, decreased truncal flexion, extension, scoliosis and limitation in activities including ballet. Evaluated by otrthopedics, and physical medicine, she received botulinum toxin injections, stretching without relief. Family history was negative for neuromuscular disorders including spastic paraparesis. Examination revealed tight hamtrings, bilateral psoas limitation, rigidity of paraspinal/ axial movement and lack of mobility. Result(s): CBC, Chem 20, CK, carnitine, acylcarnitine, lactate, pyruvate, were nl. EMG/ NCS: normal sensory/ motor conduction, norml MUP, Normal H and F reflexes. EMG; Increased firing in iliopsoas. MRI of cervical, thoracic and lumbosacral spine revealed mild thoracic scoliosis. SerumAnti Gad 65 antibodies were elevated. IVIG 1gm/kg administered x 2 days monthly for 3 months demonstrated improvement within the first month with successive improvement. No other medications were administered. Physical therapy continued. Patient returned to normal activities. Video documentation was obtained. Conclusion(s): Childhood stiff person syndrome is rare, presenting with common and uncommon physical findings. The differential diagnosis in childhood may be underrecognized. Review of the world literature demonstrated few cases. Treatment with immunodulatory therapy with IVIG or more recently rituximab, with or without benzodiazepines or baclofen may result in marked improvement.

AB  - Objective: To present a patient with isolated (pseudo)hemidystonia associated with anti-GAD antibodies. Background(s): Full spectrum of neurological syndromes associated with anti GAD antibodies is still expanding. Method(s): Case Report. Result(s): 55 year old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), thyroid disease and vitiligo and no history of injury was admitted in May 2013 because of abnormal and painful posturing of left leg and neck. In the beginning of 2012 she first noticed pain between shoulders, spreading to cervical region; she was then unable to straighten her neck. Later pain and reduced mobility of her left ankle developed. On admission she had fixed dystonic posture of the neck with left lateral flexion, trunk deviation to the left and fixed left foot plantar flexion and inversion. Number of investigations were normal or negative including: brain MRI, detailed CSF analysis, onconeuronal-antibodies (anti-Hu, Yo, Ri, CV2, amphiphysin, Ma1,2), neuronal surface antibodies (NMDA, AMPA1, AMPA 2, GABA B, LGI1, CASPR2). FDG-PET showed normal metabolism in basal ganglia bilaterally. MRI showed disc herniation at C6-C7 with irritation of left C7 nerve root. Thyroid hormones were normal, anti- TPO antibodies were highly raised (>1300 kE/L). High titre of autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) was detected in both CSF and serum. EMG showed continuous motor unit activity at rest, consistent with stiff person syndrome. She responded to intravenous immunoglobulins and was then able to dorsiflex her left foot and straighten her neck. Treatment with IVIG continued at 4-6 weeks intervals resulting in further improvement. However, as soon as IVIG intervals were prolonged to 8 weeks, her clinical state deteriorated. Conclusion(s): Anti GAD antibodies have been associated with stiff- limb or stiff-man syndrome, while hemi distribution, as seen in our patient, has not yet been reported. In our case, unusual dystonia distribution for age and presence of fixed postures accompanied by pain argued against true dystonia, but are rather consistent with pseudodystonia- a condition with abnormal postures not due to basal ganglia disorders. The history of DM1, thyroid disease and vitiligo prompted us to test her for anti-GAD antibodies, which turned out positive both in CSF and serum. We suggest that atypical presentation of (pseudo)dystonia in hemi distribution should be considered as a part of anti -GAD spectrum neurological disorders.

AB  - Question: Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurological condition characterized by stiffness and spasms of the axial and limb muscles. Cortical and spinal hyperexcitabilities are thought to be important pathophysiological mechanisms. We describe intracortical inhibitory and excitatory balance in two patients with the SPS diagnosis. Method(s): The function of intracortical inhibitory and excitatory interneurons was studied by using paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (ppTMS). Motor threshold (MT) was determined and thereafter baseline motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the abductor pollicis brevis muscle using single-pulses and 120% MT intensity. Short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) was assessed using ppTMS with interstimulus interval (ISI) of 3 ms (pulse intensities 80% and 120% MT). Intracortical facilitation (ICF) was studied using 13 ms ISI (90% and 120% MT pulse intensities). Silent period -recordings were also conducted using single pulses (120% MT pulse intensity). Result(s): Patient 1 had pronounced ICF (MEP increase 400% when compared to baseline MEP) and decreased cortical inhibition (ppMEP amplitude 92% of the baseline MEP). The silent period was found to be abnormally long (158 ms). MT was normal. Patient 2 demonstrated pronounced ICF (ppMEP amplitude three times higher than baseline MEP) and absent SICI (ppMEP amplitude same as baseline MEP amplitude). The silent period and MT were normal. Conclusion(s): SPS patients showed signs of decreased SICI and increased ICF in ppTMS-study. TMS is a promising tool in diagnosing stiff person syndrome.

TI  - Immunomodulatory therapy in stiff-person syndrome (SPS): A controlled Rituximab-randomised study
AU  - Amarandei M. 
PY  - 2017
PD  - /
AB  - Objective: The efficacy of the anti-CD20 antibody, Rituximab, in the treatment of patients with stiff-person syndrome. Background(s): SPS is a rare autoimmune progressive disorder of the central nervous system(CNS). Symptoms are stifness and painful extensor spasms. Stiffness affects the thoracolumbar paraspinal muscles, arms and legs, it has insidious onset; it appears in 3rd decade of life, without trigger infections. The diagnostic is based on clinical signs and sustained by electromyography (EMG) and high serum and cerebrospinal fluid titres of antibodies against acid decarboxylase (GAD). EMG shows the muscle stiffness is produced by involuntary co-contraction of motor units, resembling a normal voluntary contraction in needle EMG-recordings [figure 1]. Rituximab has recently been proposed to modulate B-cells activity in CNS in SPS. Method(s): Twenty anti-GAD antibody positive patients were randomised to receive Rituximab or placebo for 4 months. Ten patients received rituximab intravenously(375mg/m2) and ten received placebo (saline solution and human albumin-Flexbumin 0,4 mg/ml). After the washout, the patients crossed the alternative therapy for another 4 months. Efficiency was sustained by the titer of anti-GAD antibodies and clinical signs. Direct therapy effect was compared for both groups. The patients didn't smoke or drink alcohol. Result(s): In the group with rituximab-randomised patients, the anti-GAD antibodies decreased significantly from month one through four:7 patients (70%) had a low titer of antibodies. The scores in placebo-randomised group were the same from month 1 to 4 and declined when they crossed to rituximab therapy. Conclusion(s): The anti-GAD antibodies declined after rituximab, but not after placebo. Our clinical succesful utilisation of a monoconal anti-B cell antibody treatments leads to the conclusion that SPS is a B cell mediated autoimmune disease (Figure Presented) .

AB  - Objective: To describe a case of stiff-limb syndrome with ataxic features which had delayed EMG findings and improvement to IVIG. Background(s): Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is part of a spectrum of progressive autoimmune neurological diseases that also include isolated cerebellar ataxias, progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM), epilepsy, and autoimmune dementia. Stiff-limb syndrome (SLS) is differentiated from SPS clinically through the isolated involvement of appendicular muscle groups and early sparing of paraspinal musculature. Barker, et al. described SLS patients as having rigidity, painful spasms, and abnormal postures of the distal limb, with developing sphincter or brainstem involvement and almost none having generalized myoclonic jerks or truncal spasms. Prognosis is poor for SLS patients with many becoming wheelchair dependent. Method(s): Case report. Result(s): A 52-year-old woman with history of pernicious anemia and B12 deficiency, and a family history of autoimmunity, presented with two months of axial ataxia, lower back pain, and unsteady gait. She was hospitalized after a fall and found to have a low B12 of 178 ng/mL with a normal copper level. She was given intramuscular B12 supplementation, physical therapy, but with no improvement. Neurological examination showed considerable bilateral leg spasticity to passive movement, truncal titubation, and a bilateral intention tremor and dysmetria of her arms. Initial EMG was normal but repeat EMG, three months later, demonstrated spontaneous, continuous motor unit action potentials with normal morphology in the left tibialis anterior only occurring while patient was relaxed. Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase antibody (GAD-65) was positive at 30.0 U/mL (Reference range <=1.0 U/mL). Medication trials with benzodiazepines, baclofen, pregabalin, dantrolene, and gabapentin were not effective. IVIG was initiated with dramatic improvement in pain but no improvement in spasticity or gait until she completed 10 trials. After her 12th consecutive dose of IVIG, she has considerable improvement in spasticity and gait and was able to return to work full time. Conclusion(s): Our patient is unique as she had mild ataxia, no dystonia, and delayed unilateral, positive EMG findings. She had a tremendous recovery and returned to full time nursing duty. The exact duration of treatment is still unknown and further research into the long-term prognosis of SLS is needed.

AB  - Introduction: Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by progressive muscle rigidity and stiffness superimposed on painful muscle spasms predominantly affecting the muscles of trunk and proximal limbs. GAD 65 Ab are found in high titers in these patients and have been linked to its pathogenesis. GAD65 Ab are also elevated in other neurological conditions such as cerebellar ataxia, epilepsy, palatal tremor, and autoimmune limbic encephalitis (LE). Case presentation: A 48 year old right handed Caucasian female presented with a 2 month history of recurrent severe headaches, cognitive impairment with decreased memory, behavioral symptoms in the form of agitation, hallucinations and paranoia with episodes of disorientation, confusion and visual blurring. She complained of stiffness and rigidity involving neck and back muscles with muscle spasms and difficulty ambulating with frequent falls. Motor system examination revealed generalized rigidity, muscle strength was 5/5 in all four limbs, deep tendon reflexes were normal, and down going planters bilaterally. Sensory examination was normal with intact cerebellar signs. Neuropsychological testing showed cognitive decline in the form of impairment of short-term memory. MRI of the brain with contrast did not show any significant abnormality. Lumbar puncture and CSF analysis done revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis, with elevated white cell count and lymphocytes. EEG monitoring showed background slowing. Given the patient's clinical presentation and investigational workup, a diagnosis of LE was considered. Patient received treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 60 gm x 1 infusion and unexpectedly had improvement of her muscle stiffness, which raised a suspicion for SPS. Prior to IVIG, GAD65 Ab initially measured 6.7 IU/ml (0-5 IU/ml), and two months later 148 IU/ml (0-5IU/ml). TSH was 0.98 micro IU/ml (0.1-5 micro IU/ml) and free T4 was low at 0.66 ng/dl (0.71-1.85 ng/dl). TPO Ab were elevated at 45 IU/ml (0-35 IU/ml), as well as thyroglobulin Ab at 42.4 IU/ml (0-40 IU/ml). Levothyroxine 125 mcg/day was started for her autoimmune hypothyroidism. A1C was normal at 5.3% without evidence for diabetes. Diazepam 5 mg four times a day was initiated and increased to 10 mg four times per day. At follow up, she reported improvement in muscle stiffness/spasms, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms. Conclusion(s): Although GAD65 Ab are implicated in the pathogenesis of both SPS and LE, their association is quite rare. Here we present a case of LE with inadvertent diagnosis of GAD65-positive SPS determined after successful treatment with IVIG therapy.

AB  - Objective: To report four cases of a rare disorder, GAD (+) Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS), treated with Intrathecal baclofen therapy. Background(s): Stiff person syndrome is a rare disorder of unclear etiology characterized by progressive rigidity and stiffness resulting in postural deformities. Stiff-Person syndrome is an autoimmune disorder and highly correlates with the presence of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies. Baclofen, Benzodiazepines and autoimmune suppressive treatments as steroids, Rituximab, and plasma exchange have been used in SPS patients. However, when the above treatments are inadequate, intrathecal baclofen may be used. Result(s): We report 4 patients with GAD(+) SPS which presented with severe refractory neurological manifestations of the disease, and greatly benefited from intrathecal baclofen (ITB) therapy. A 34 year old man diagnosed with SPS presented with refractory progressive spasms of the lower trunk. Unresponsive to oral baclofen, diazepam, steroids and eventually IVIG, the patient has lost his ability to walk. Treated with implantation of ITB, the patient's spasm had decreased dramatically, and he had regained his ability to walk. The second and the third patients were a 33 year old woman and a 17 years old girl diagnosed with acute SPS developed to a life threatening disease. Starting with increased muscular tonus, the two patients had developed progressive diaphragmatic spasm leading to respiratory failure. The patient underwent an implantation of ITB pump and the diaphragm contractility was regained. Soon after, the patient had withdrawal from mechanical ventilation. The two patients had been discharged from the hospital fully functional, with a substantial reduction in their symptoms. The fourth patient was a 31 year old woman with painful spasms of the legs and trunk. Despite IV immunoglobulin and plasma exchange therapy treatments, spasms progressed to the muscles of the neck and shoulders. An ITB pump was implanted and considerable clinical improvement was demonstrated. Conclusion(s): We describe four cases of GAD(+) SPS patients, presented with severe debilitating and even life threatening manifestations of their condition. After poor response to conventional SPS therapy, including oral baclofen, benzodiazepines, steroids and plasma exchange, all the 4 patients described here highly benefited from intrathecal baclofen (ITB) therapy.

AB  - Introduction: Stiff-person Syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune central nervous system disorder characterized by rigidity of the trunk and proximal limb muscles due to continuous co-contraction of agonists and antagonists with superimposed intermittent and often disabling spasms of the involved musculature. Approximately 50% of SPS patients report dyspnea contributing to their functional impairment. This study investigates the frequency and severity of dyspnea and associated pulmonary function abnormalities in SPS. Method(s): SPS patients were recruited from a University based neurology clinic. Demographic information, co-morbidities, history of lung disease, and smoking history were recorded for each subject. Dyspnea was assessed on each subject via a vertical Visual Analogue Scale assessed on the day of study visit (VAS1day) and over the preceding two weeks (VAS2weeks), and by the University of San Diego Shortness Of Breath Questionnaire (UCSD-SOBQ). Dyspnea "descriptors" were assessed for each subject. Standardized assessments of SPS severity-the "Heightened Sensitivity Scale" and the "Distribution of Stiffness Scale" were assessed by an experienced neurologist. Spirometry was performed on all patients on the same day as assessment of dyspnea. Result(s): Fifteen of 16 consented patients had evaluable data. Mean age was 56.1 +13.1 SD years. 15/16 were female. 14/15 complained of dyspnea: 10 both at rest and with exertion, 3 only with exertion, and 1 only at rest. The two most common dyspnea descriptors were "My chest feels tight" and "My chest is constricted". Mean UCSD-SOBQ score was 61.2 + 37.95. Group mean FVC % predicted was 76.5 +17.99; FEV1 % predicted 81.6 +19.72; FEV1/FVC 85.2 +10.02. 5/15 patients showed a restrictive pattern on spirometry, 9 had normal spirometry, and 1 patient with concomitant bronchiectasis showed a combined restrictive/obstructive pattern. There was a significant inverse correlation between VAS2weeks and FVC %predicted (r =-0.61, p=0.017) and FEV1 %predicted (r =-0.65, p=0.008). There was no significant association between pulmonary function and any of the following: VAS1day, UCSD-SOBQ, Distribution of Stiffness, or Heightened Sensitivity. No correlation between any dyspnea score and any measure of SPS disease severity was found. Conclusion(s): Dyspnea in SPS is common, and occurs both at rest and with exertion. Many patients show a restrictive spirometry pattern, and there is some association between simple measures of dyspnea and pulmonary function. We postulate that chest wall constriction and/or spasm of the muscles of the trunk may be the underlying mechanism leading to the sensation of dyspnea. Potential involvement of respiratory muscles is unknown.

AB  - We report two cases of antibody-negative paraneoplastic/autoimmune encephalitis who were treated empirically with immunosuppression leading to clinical improvement. Case 1 is a 68-year-old male who presented with 72-h history of progressive peripheral limb rigidity, hypertonia and myoclonus, refractory to anti-spasmodics and eventually requiring propofol infusion and intubation for airway management. Neuroimaging, whole body imaging for malignancies and EEG were non-diagnostic and a presumptive diagnosis of progressive inflammatory encephalomyelitis (PERM) was made based on clinical phenotype. CSF showed elevated protein and the presence of mononuclear cells, but was eventually negative for autoimmune/paraneoplastic antibodies including anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and anti-glycine receptor antibodies. The patient was sequentially treated with pulse corticosteroids, plasmapheresis, IVIG, rituximab, bortezomib and cyclophosphamide leading to significant functional and neurological improvement. Case 2 is a 66-year-old male presenting with a 3-week history of progressive ataxia, diplopia and opsoclonus and facial myoclonus. A diagnosis of opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome was made based on his clinical phenotype. Neuroimaging was unremarkable but PET scan showed increased FDG uptakes at base of tongue and left neck lymph nodes. Biopsies confirmed a p16 positive poorly differentiated carcinoma (stage III). CSF studies showed lymphocytosis, normal protein and were negative for oligoclonal bands. Enterovirus and herpes virus PCRs were negative. Limbic encephalitis and paraneoplastic antibodies were also negative. Treatment undertaken comprised sequential pulse corticosteroids, plasmapheresis, IVIG and rituximab leading to partial neurological improvement. Up to half of autoimmune/paraneoplastic encephalitis is antibody negative. Even when present, antibody detection is often significantly delayed due to limited availability of testing. However, early use of immunotherapy is critical for optimal outcome in these diseases, which are often rapidly progressive. These two cases emphasise the importance of using the patients' clinical phenotype in guiding the early initiation of immunosuppression in autoimmune/paraneoplastic encephalitis.

AB  - Background: Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare disorder presenting with progressive stiffness and spasms of the musculature of the trunk and limbs. SPS is reported very rarely in children and adolescents, with 5 cases over 25 years in a recent 99 patient cohort. Method(s): Case Study Results: Herein we report a 15 year old female, presenting with acute onset of rapidly progressive spasticity of the lower extremities. Initial exam was remarkable for markedly limited left knee range of motion, in addition to asymmetrical knee spastic catch and hyper-reflexia. EMG revealed almost continuous motor unit activity which dissipated with voluntary muscle contraction. Diagnosis was confirmed by high titres of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD65) antibodies >25,000 units/ml. The patient was initially treated with IVIG, baclofen, and diazepam followed by IV methylprednisolone, with mild subjective improvements. One day following the first rituximab treatment, she achieved spontaneous knee flexion and regained the ability to ambulate independently. There is a residual spastic catch at the knees. Conclusion(s): This case highlights that SPS, albeit extremely rare, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acquired spasticity in children. Also noteworthy is the relatively rapid resumption of function with aggressive immunomodulatory treatments in this historically devastating disorder.

AB  - Introduction: Respiratory manifestations in Stiff-person Syndrome (SPS) patients have not been systematically investigated and adequately managed. Approximately 50% of SPS patients report dyspnea contributing to their functional impairment. This study investigates the frequency and severity of dyspnea and associated pulmonary function abnormalities in SPS. Method(s): SPS patients were recruited prospectively from neurology clinic in a single university center. Demographic information, co-morbidities, history of lung disease, and smoking history were recorded for each subject. Dyspnea was assessed on each subject via a vertical Visual Analogue Scale assessed on the day of study visit (VAS1day) and over the preceding two weeks (VAS2weeks), and by the Universi-ty of San Diego Shortness Of Breath Questionnaire (UCSD-SOBQ). Dyspnea 'descriptors' were assessed for each subject. Standardized assessments of SPS severity-the Heightened Sensitivity Scale and the Distribution of Stiffness Scale were assessed by an experienced neurologist. Spi-rometry was performed on all patients on the same day as assessment of dyspnea. Result(s): Fifteen of 16 consented patients had evaluable data. Mean age was 56.1 113.1 SD years. 15/16 were female. 14/15 complained of dyspnea: 10 both at rest and with exertion, 3 only with exertion, and 1 only at rest. The two most common dyspnea descriptors were 'My chest feels tight' and 'My chest is constricted'. Mean UCSD-SOBQ score was 61.21 37.95. Group mean FVC % predicted was 76.5 117.99; FEV1% predicted 81.6 119.72; FEV1/FVC 85.2 110.02. 5/15 patients showed a restrictive pattern on spirometry, 9 had normal spirometry, and 1 patient with concomitant bronchiectasis showed a combined restrictive/obstructive pattern. There was a significant inverse correlation between VAS2weeks and FVC %predicted (r 5 20.61, p50.017) and FEV1%predicted (r 5 20.65, p50.008). There was no significant association between pulmonary function and any of the following: VAS1day, UCSD-SOBQ, Distribution of Stiffness, or Heightened Sensitivity. No correlation between any dyspnea score and any measure of SPS disease severity was found. CoNCLusions: Dyspnea in SPS is common, and occurs both at rest and with exertion. Many patients show a restrictive spirometry pattern, and there is some association between simple measures of dyspnea and pulmonary function. We postulate that chest wall constriction and/or superimposed spasm of the muscles of the trunk may be the underlying mechanism leading to the sensation of dyspnea and objective respiratory compromise. Potential involvement of diaphragmatic muscles is unknown.

AB  - Objective: To assess structural and functional changes in the afferent visual system of patients with Stiff-Person Syndrome (SPS). Background(s): SPS is a rare neuroimmunological disorder characterized by progressive rigidity and painful muscle spasms. The majority of patients exhibit autoantibodies directed against glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD). SPS can be misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis due to overlapping symptoms and demographics which delays appropriate diagnosis. SPS patients often have visual complaints which are often under-recognized and therefore have not been fully characterized in SPS. Method(s): Forty SPS patients and matched healthy controls underwent Cirrus HD-OCT, and a subset of 30 patients and matched controls underwent 100%, 2.5% and 1.25%-contrast letter-acuity testing. An automatic macular segmentation method was used to compute the combined thickness of the ganglion cell+inner plexiform layer (GCIP). Mixed effects linear regression models were used to investigate whether retinal layer thicknesses and visual function differed between SPS and controls. Result(s): The SPS cohort was slightly older than controls, although not significantly (mean difference=3 years;p=0.17), and had a mean modified Rankin scale of 2.0(SD=0.66). Adjusting for age and a history of diabetes, the mean retinal thickness values were significantly lower in the SPS cohort (mean difference=5.1 mum;p=0.004), which appears to be driven by a thinned GCIP layer thickness (mean difference=1.9 mum;p=0.012). SPS patients exhibited lower visual acuity on 100%, 2.5% and 1.25% contrast letteracuity charts (mean difference=4.3 letters, 5.8 letters and 5.0 letters;p=0.002, p=0.009 and p=0.031, respectively). Moreover, SPS patients without a history of diabetes exhibited significantly thinner GCIP layer thicknesses (p=0.05), and significantly worse visual acuity on high contrast, 2.5% contrast and 1.25% contrast charts (mean differences= 6.2, 6.4 and 5.4 letters; p=0.001, p=0.003, p=0.026, respectively) compared to controls. Conclusion(s): SPS patients have mild visual dysfunction compared to healthy controls, as well as thinned GCIP layers. These findings suggest that SPS may cause retinal neuronal pathology, possibly resulting from an autoimmune retinopathy. Therefore SPS may share a common pathway(s) for retinal degeneration with MS. Clinicians should be aware of the expanding spectrum of SPS to help prevent misdiagnosis as more common conditions like MS.

AB  - Background: Anti-Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies are associated with neurological disorders, such as Stiff-person syndrome (SPS), cerebellarataxia, epilepsy, limbic encephalitis. Objective(s): To determine clinical entities and features of neurologic disorders associated with anti-GAD antibodies, we examined anti-GAD antibodies titers and time-dependent changes of these antibodies as compared with type I diabetes mellitus (T1DM) without neurologic disorders. Patients and Methods/Material and Methods: We studied 6 patients with anti-GAD antibody-positive neurologic disorders included 2 with SPS, 1with cerebellar ataxia, 1with limbic encephalitis, 1with epilepsy, and 1 with multiple cranial neuropathy as compared with 88 T1DM patients positive for anti-GAD antibodies. Result(s): All anti-GAD antibody-positive neurologic disorders patients had elevated serum anti-GAD antibody titers (1,440 to 270,000 U/mL: normal <=1). In most of T1DM patients, the anti-GAD antibody titers were between 1.0 and 100 U/mL. Five of six neurologic disorders patients were performed CSF analyses, and CSF anti-GAD antibody titers were also increased (30-770 U/mL). The anti-GAD antibody index in the four of five patients reviewed was >1.0 suggesting intrathecal synthesis of anti-GAD antibody. Three of six patients were associated with neoplasm (breast cancer, thyroid cancer, thymoma). Five of six patients were treated with immunotherapy, and showed clear effectiveness. The anti-GAD antibody titers of T1DM patients decreased over time. However, those of neurologic disorders patients tended to remain at a high level, and some cases showed re-elevation. Conclusion(s): Neurologic disorders associated with anti-GAD antibodies were improved by immune therapy, and anti-GAD antibody titers and the anti-GAD antibody index would be correlated with disease activity and indicators of therapeutic evaluation.

AB  - We report a video presentation of a previously well 7-year-old boy who presented with worsening dysphagia, ptosis, rigidity, myoclonic jerks, high blood pressure and urinary retention. There was no evidence of encephalopathy. He had generalized muscle rigidity and stiffness but had normal creatinine kinase CK levels. He went through extensive investigations initially which were unrevealing, such as whole-body MRI and cere-brospinal, blood and urine studies. He was initially treated with IVIG as the initial provisional diagnosis was atypical GBS, a demyelinating disease or an auto-immune paraneo-plastic condition. Steroids were subsequently introduced with a marked clinical improvement. The diagnosis of Progressive Encephalomyelitis with Rigidity and Myoclonus (PERM) was confirmed, due to a positive glycine receptor antibody. He relapsed soon after the steroids were stopped and continued to require intermittent IVIG therapy with complete recovery in between. The video shows axial stiffness with limb rigidity, 'tin sol-dier' gait, bilateral ptosis, myoclonic jerks and exaggerated startle. The video also shows the patient's status post treatment which has returned to premorbid state. PERM is progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus, which is part of the spectrum of the Stiff Person Syndrome. It is an extremely rare but severe neurological syndrome characterized by muscular rigidity and spasms, as well as brainstem and autonomic dysfunction. It can be associated with anti-GAD, GlyR, DPPX (dipeptidyl peptidase-like protein 6) and amphiphysin antibodies. All of these autoantibod-ies may variably be associated with malignant tumors. Given its readily responsiveness to immunotherapy, PERM should be considered in the differential diagnosis in any child presenting with similar symptoms.

AB  - Case/Program Description: A 46-year-old woman with a history of left breast invasive ductal carcinoma s/p neoadjuvant chemotherapy and mastectomy. Fourteen months later, she presented with progressive stiffening of the bilateral lower extremities causing her to become bedbound over a 2-month period. She underwent an extensive neurologic work-up including imaging of the brain and thoracic/lumbar spine, EMG, rheumatologic tests, infectious disease tests (including tropical paraparesis) and paraneoplastic antibody panel. The patient was found to be GAD65 positive and diagnosed with paraneoplastic stiff person syndrome (PSPS). The patient was treated with several rounds of IVIG with partial response. Due to poorly controlled lower extremity muscle spasms she eventually suffered bilateral hip fractures. Setting(s): Tertiary care hospital. Result(s): The patient underwent left hip hemiarthroplasty due to femoral neck fracture. Two weeks later she complained of worsening pain of the right hip. She was found to have an acute right hip fracture and underwent right hip hemiarthroplasty. The etiology of her bilateral hip fractures is believed to be secondary to severe spasms as there was no history of trauma and pathology was negative for metastatic disease. The patient was subsequently transferred to the acute inpa-tient rehabilitation unit and achieved improvements in her Functional Independence Measure scores. Discussion(s): PSPS is a rare disease process that can lead to significant physical impairment. In this case, uncontrolled spasms likely contributed to her bilateral hip fractures. Musculoskeletal paininPSPS patients should be investigated radiographically to rule out metastases and fractures. Conclusion(s): PSPS is an uncommon manifestation of cancer. Severe muscle spasms may lead to complications including fractures. Rehabilitation interventions improved patient function and should be considered an integral part of the management of this condition.

AB  - Case/Program Description: A 44-year-old man with a past medical history of agoraphobia, depression, migraines, and hypertension who presented with low back and hip pain, and impaired ambulation secondary to "legs locking up," requiring the use of an assistive device. Initially, he developed pressure like sensations in his lumbar spine, later being diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) after developing bilateral foot drop and muscular atrophy. GBS treatment provided minimal improvement. Ten years later, a "sporting injury" cascaded this current progressive symptomatology. Physical and massage therapy provided only a 30% improvement. Further investigation raised suspicion for stiff person syndrome and anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody was tested, revealing antibody levels >5,000 units/mL. The patient then received three 40mg/day intravenous immunoglobin (IVIG) treatments in addition to Baclofen, with minimal generalized improvement. An additional 3 days of IVIG then provided significant functional improvement, particularly with ambu-lation. Follow-up anti-GAD antibody levels revealed a 66% decline. A third round of IVIG treatment was planned in conjunction with physical therapy and Baclofen to continue this improvement. Setting(s): Neurology clinic. Result(s): Decreasing levels of anti-GAD antibodies in a patient with stiff person syndrome lead to marked functional improvements. Discussion(s): Stiff person syndrome, an uncommon disorder, is typified by progressive truncal muscle stiffness, axial muscle spasms, gener-alized rigidity, and wide based gait. These symptoms causing marked functional decline. The primary pathophysiology is related to anti-GAD antibodies. Increased antibody levels lead to increased muscle activity secondary to decreased central nervous system (CNS) inhibition as a result of decreased CNS gamma amino butyric acid. Reduction in antibody level with IVIG treatment not only reduces presenting symptoms but also allows patients to make marked functional improvement in conjunction with Baclofen and physical therapy. Conclusion(s): Proper diagnosis and treatment of the debilitating stiff person syndrome can lead to significant functional improvements.

AU  - Lee M.

PD  - /
AB  - Case/Program Description: Ms. S presented to our emergency department with progressive bilateral leg pain and tightness for the past year. She was having worsening rigidity with resulting contrac-tures, and started requiring a wheelchair for mobility. As she had fallen multiple times at home, she was admitted for further workup. PM and R was consulted for evaluation of her leg stiffness. On examination, there was notable rigidity and co-contraction in her bilateral lower extremities along with flexion contractures of her knees and ankles. She also had marked toe clawing. However, there was no axial involvement or startle response, despite multiple attempts to illicit these signs. MRI of the neuroaxis was unremarkable, except for an amorphous, nonspecific, non-enhancing T2 cord signal abnormality at the cervical medullary junction. A movement lab study was suggestive of a CNS hyperexcitability disorder. An EMG did not show evidence for a peripheral cause for her symptoms, though it did suggest some functional overlay. An extensive lab workup was performed, including CSF studies, and was remarkable for high titers of GAD65 antibody in both the blood and the CSF. She was started on diazepam 5mg TID and a course of IVIG with rapid improvement in her symptoms. Setting(s): Tertiary care hospital. Result(s): At 2 weeks follow-up, her pain and rigidity is much more tolerable, and she can ambulate without a gait aid. Discussion(s): Cases of stiff person syndrome without axial involvement have been described, but this is the first reported case, to our knowledge, of stiff person syndrome (or stiff limb syndrome), without the characteristic hyperekplexia. Conclusion(s): Stiff person syndrome can be present even without the expected hyperekplexia and axial rigidity. Benzodiazepines can be beneficial in these cases.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Approximately 50% of stiff-person syndrome (SPS) patients report dyspnea contributing to their functional impairment, which is largely underdiagnosed. OBJECTIVE(S): To investigate the frequency and severity of dyspnea and associated pulmonary function abnormalities in SPS. METHOD(S): On the study visit day and the preceding 2 weeks, dyspnea of 16 SPS patients (recruited prospectively) was assessed via a vertical visual analogue scale (VAS) and by the University of San Diego Shortness of Breath Questionnaire (UCSD-SOBQ). SPS severity was evaluated using validated scales by the same neurologist on the same day as spirometry was performed. RESULT(S): Dyspnea was reported by 14/16 patients. The mean UCSD-SOBQ score was 61.2+/-37.95. Group mean forced vital capacity (FVC)% predicted was 76.5+/-17.99; forces expiratory volume (FEV)1% predicted was 81.6+/-19.72; forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/FVC was 85.2+/-10.02. On spirometry 5/15 patients showed a restrictive pattern, 9 had normal spirometry, and 1 patient with concomitant bronchiectasis showed a combined restrictive/obstructive pattern. There was a significant inverse correlation between VAS at 2 weeks and FVC% predicted (r=-0.61, p=0.017) and FEV1% predicted (r=-0.65, p=0.008). There was no significant association between pulmonary function and the following: VAS at 1 day, UCSDSOBQ, distribution of stiffness, or heightened sensitivity. No correlation between dyspnea score and measures of SPS severity was found. SUMMARY/CONCLUSION: Dyspnea in SPS is common, occurring both at rest and with exertion. Many patients show a restrictive spirometry pattern. We postulate that chest wall constriction with superimposed truncal muscle spasms may be the underlying mechanism for the sensation of dyspnea and objective respiratory compromise. Potential involvement of diaphragmatic muscles is unknown.

AB  - Objective: To report the main syndrome of dipeptidyl-peptidase-like protein 6 (DPPX) antibody- associated encephalitis, immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass, and the antibody effects on DPPX/ Kv4.2 potassium channels. Method(s): A retrospective analysis of new patients and cases reported since 2013 was performed. IgG subclass and effects of antibodies on cultured neurons were determined with described techniques. Result(s): Nine new patients were identified (median age 57 years, range 36-69 years). All developed severe prodromal weight loss or diarrhea followed by cognitive dysfunction (9), memory deficits (5), CNS hyperexcitability (8; hyperekplexia, myoclonus, tremor, or seizures), or brainstem or cerebellar dysfunction (7). The peak of the disease was reached 8 months (range 1-54 months) after onset. All patients had both IgG4 and IgG1 DPPX antibodies. In cultured neurons, the antibodies caused a decrease of DPPX clusters and Kv4.2 protein that was reversible on removal of the antibodies. Considering the current series and previously reported cases (total 39), 67% developed the triad: weight loss (median 20 kg; range 8-53 kg)/gastrointestinal symptoms, cognitive-mental dysfunction, and CNS hyperexcitability. Outcome was available from 35 patients (8 not treated with immunotherapy): 60% had substantial or moderate improvement, 23% had no improvement (most of them not treated), and 17% died. Relapses occurred in 8 of 35 patients (23%) and were responsive to immunotherapy. Conclusion(s): DPPX antibodies are predominantly IgG1 and IgG4 and associate with cognitivemental deficits and symptoms of CNS hyperexcitability that are usually preceded by diarrhea, other gastrointestinal symptoms, and weight loss. The disorder is responsive to immunotherapy, and this is supported by the reversibility of the antibody effects in cultured neurons.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: A 60-year-old man presented with a 6-month history of low back pain and progressive rigidity of the trunk and lower limbs, followed by pruritus, dysphonia, hyperhydrosis, and urinary retention. Brain and spinal imaging were normal. EMG showed involuntary motor unit hyperactivity. Onconeural, antiglutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD), voltage-gated potassium channel, and dipeptidyl peptidase-like protein 6 (DPPX) autoantibodies were negative. CSF was negative. Symptoms were partially responsive to baclofen, gabapentin, and clonazepam, but he eventually developed severe dysphagia. Antiglycine receptor (anti-GlyR) antibodies turned out positive on both serum and CSF. A plasmapheresis cycle was completed with good clinical response. A PET scan highlighted an isolated metabolically active axillary lymphnode that turned out to be a classic type Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), in the absence of bone marrow infiltration nor B symptoms. Polychemotherapy with ABVD protocol was completed with good clinical response and at 1-year follow-up the neurological examination is normal. Background(s): Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) is a rare and severe neurological syndrome characterized by muscular rigidity and spasms as well as brain stem and autonomic dysfunction. It can be associated with anti-GAD, GlyR, and DPPX antibodies. All of these autoantibodies may be variably associated with malignant tumors and their response to immunotherapy, as well as to tumor removal, is not easily predictable. Conclusion(s): Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus has already been described in association with HL, but this is the first case report of a HL manifesting as anti-GlyR antibodies related PERM. Our report highlights the importance of malignancy screening in autoimmune syndromes of suspected paraneoplastic origin.Copyright © 2017 Borellini, Lanfranconi, Bonato, Trezzi, Franco, Torretta, Bresolin and Di Fonzo.

AB  - Background: Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurological disease resulting in stiffness and spasm of muscles. It initially affects the axial muscles and then spread to limb muscles. Emotional stress exacerbated the symptoms and signs of the disease. The pathophysiology of the disease is caused by the decreased level of the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) activity due to an autoantibody against GAD that decreases the level of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In this paper, we present a case of atypical presentation of SPS with lower limb stiffness misdiagnosed as conversion disorder. Case presentation: We report a patient with atypical presentation of SPS with lower limb stiffness and gait disorder misdiagnosed as conversion disorder for a year. Her antithyroid peroxidase antibody (anti-TPO Ab) level was 75 IU (normal value: 0-34 IU). Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was administered (2gr/kg, 5 days) for the patient that showed significant improvement in the follow-up visit. Conclusion(s): It is essential that in any patient with bizarre gait disorder and suspicious to conversion disorder due to the reversibility of symptoms, SPS and other movement disorder should be considered.

AB  - Objective: Delineate pathophysiology of gaze-holding function in stiff person syndrome (SPS). Background(s): Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) catalyzes conversion of glutamate to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Anti-GAD antibodies, as seen in SPS, can compromise this function. Proof of this mechanism comes from peculiar eye movements in SPS such as downbeat nystagmus, dysmetria, impaired pursuit, and impaired vestibulo-ocular reflex cancellation. It is possible that eye movement dysfunction in SPS is multifactorial, due to deficiency in GABA and excess of glutamate. Method(s): We measured gaze holding in 11 SPS patients using highresolution oculography to capture horizontal and vertical eye positions. Patterns of deficits were dissected via offline analysis of eye position. Specific waveforms and known principles of eye movement control systems were then applied to determine the role of GABA versus glutamate in gaze holding behaviors. Result(s): Downbeat nystagmus and horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus were the most common deficits identified. Downbeat nystagmus presented in 9 patients, while 6 had horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus. They were co-existent in some patients. Universally, horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus had velocity-decreasing waveform, and the slow-phase eye velocity reduced as the desired eye position reached central null position. Null position for vertical nystagmus varied in patients: in 2 it was downward, while in 7 it was in the upward position. Seven patients with downbeat nystagmus had velocity-increasing waveform, and 2 had velocity-decreasing waveform. Two patients had opsoclonus. Visually guided saccades were slow in 2 patients with opsoclonus and 1 with normal gaze holding. Conclusion(s): Gaze-holding deficits in SPS causes dysfunction of cerebellar neural integrator, which explains the mechanism of eye-inorbit position dependence of slow-phase velocity of horizontal and vertical nystagmus, null position and velocity-increasing/decreasing waveforms of downbeat nystagmus. However, opsoclonus is not explained. Excessive glutamate causes reverberations of saccadic burst neurons in the reciprocally innervating circuit. Glutamatergic excess explains the opsoclonus in SPS patients.

AB  - Objective: To describe the diagnosis and treatment of two cases of anti-glycine receptor antibody positive PERM Background: PERM is a life-threatening autoimmune condition, which presents with rigidity, myoclonus, hyperekplexia, autonomic instability and oculomotor anomalies. Symptoms heterogeneity at presentation and a good response to treatment was previously described (Carvajal-Gonzalez et al., 2014). Method(s): We present two cases of PERM recently treated in our department. Result(s): Case 1 is a 62-year-old woman who presented with complete horizontal gaze palsy, rigidity, lower limb weakness, which progressed to inability to walk, diaphoresis and hyperreflexia. She had positive CSF and serum Anti-GlyR antibodies. Her MR brain showed confluent T2/FLAIR hyperintensities which extended between the periventricular and subcortical regions [Figure 1]. The rest of her investigations are summarised in [table 1]. She had a good response to immune-suppressive treatment (methylprednisolone, IV immunoglobulin, mycophenolate mofetil). She recovered mobility within a week and was well at three months follow-up. Case 2 is a 58-year-old man who presented following a four-month prodrome of anorexia, with hiccups, impaired swallow, irritability, visual hallucinations and rigidity evolving into an agitated delirium with pyrexia, diaphoresis and stimulus-sensitive myoclonus. He developed respiratory arrest with pulseless electrical activity and was successfully resuscitated and subsequently had several generalised seizures. CSF and blood were positive for anti-glycine receptor antibodies. Anti-NMDA, VGKC, andGADantibodies were detected in his blood. The rest of his investigations are summarised in [table 1]. Interestingly, and MR spine performed as part of his work-up showed multiple new vertebral end-plate fractures, probably caused by the hyperekplexia associated with his condition. There was little response to IV methylprednisolone and IV immunoglobulin. Initial improvement with plasmapheresis (Figure presented) plateaued so rituximab was administered, with significant improvement. Currently, the patient is still mechanically ventilated, but regained consciousness and can communicatewith a speaking valve. Conclusion(s): Our presentation highlights the differences in phenomenology and response to treatment in two patients with antiglycine receptor antibody-positive PERM.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Stif-person Syndrome (SPs) is a disorder characterized by muscle rigidity and episodic spasms in axial and limb musculature, along with heightened sensitivity to external stimuli. OBJECTIVE(S): To describe the natural history of SPS, the extent of accumulated disability, and the associated clinical features in patients prospectively followed for up to 8 years in a single center. METHOD(S): Our collective cohort included 57 patients with mean age at disease onset 42 years (range: 22-60). Of these, 32 patients were examined every 6 months over 2 years without receiving immune therapies to assess the disease progression using quantitative scales of stifness index and heightened sensitivity. RESULT(S): The most frequent initial symptom was leg stifness, followed by paraspinal muscle rigidity and painful spasms in 95% of patients. Although none required assistance for ambulation during the frst 2 years of disease, 46 patients (80%) lost the ability to walk independently during the followup period, despite symptomatic medications. In the longitudinal cohort, the number of stif areas increased (p<0.0001), consistent with worsening functional status and quality of life. A strong association with the HLA-DR or DQ haplotypes was confrmed. SUMMARY/CONCLUSION: This is the largest prospective study of SPS patients, followed for up to 8 years at a single center, and the frst to provide longitudinal data on SPS natural course in a large patient subgroup using objective clinical measures. The study shows that SPS is a progressive autoimmune disease that leads to disability if therapy is not initiated early or immunotherapy is not applied.

AB  - Introduction: The stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by muscle stiffness and recurrent episodes of painful muscle spasms in the trunk and limbs. Several subtypes exist such as the classic SPS that affects all muscles and provokes truncal stiffness. Rarely it can be a paraneoplastic syndrome . Another atypical form called Stiff-Limb Syndrome (Partial SPS) and only affects the legs. The etiology is unclear but the presence of Anti-GAD antibodies suggests an auto-immune origin. The antibodies inhibit GABAergic circuits inducting a neuronal hyper-excitability. In it's classic form, 30% of the patients are type I diabetics . Case Report: A 52-year-old man of African descent is admitted to the emergency department with the following symptoms: muscle cramps and continuous painful spasms in both legs for the past 2 weeks, increased tiredness and restricted mobility. He has no medical history. His general practitioner prescribed him magnesium but the condition has not improved. Clinical examination showed continuous muscle spasms in both calves and quadriceps and involuntary thumb shaking . No sensory or motor deficit was observed but a Chvostek sign was noted . The blood tests showed a high rate of creatine kinase and a monoclonal IgG Lambda component. No ionic disorders were found with normal rates of calcium and magnesium observed. Cerebral and cervical RMN showed a negligible narrowing of the cervical canal. The cerebrospinal fluid did not show any abnormality. Electromyography found fasciculations of twin muscles. No electric signs of polyneuritis or myogenous defect were noted. The rate of anti-GAD antibodies was increased . The patient was treated with Diazepam 5 mg four times a day and after 5 days a decrease of the spasms was observed. Three weeks after the treatment an electromyography and a blood test showed that the spasms had almost disappear and that the level of creatine kinase in blood test was normal. Conclusion(s): The diagnosis of Stiff-person syndrome is not based on an individual test but is rather a hypothesis supported by the following criteria:-Episodic spams-A positive therapeutic response to oral diazepam (evaluated by electromyography)-An absence of other neurologic disorders-High rates of anti-GAD antibodies. Antiamphiphysin, anti-GABARA, anti-RI antibodies and anti-gephyrin may be present in GAD-negative patients. The lack of antibodies does not exclude a SPS. The prognosis for patients with stiff-person syndrome is guarded. A functional decline is generally noted in most patients.

AB  - Background Glycine receptor alpha-1 subunit (GlyRalpha1)-immunoglobulin G (IgG) is diagnostic of stiff-person syndrome (SPS) spectrum but has been reported detectable in other neurologic diseases for which significance is less certain. Methods To assess GlyRalpha1-IgGs as biomarkers of SPS spectrum among patients and controls, specimens were tested using cell-based assays (binding [4degreeC] and modulating [antigen endocytosing, 37degreeC]). Medical records of seropositive patients were reviewed. Results GlyRalpha1-IgG (binding antibody) was detected in 21 of 247 patients with suspected SPS spectrum (8.5%) and in 8 of 190 healthy subject sera (4%) but not CSF. Among 21 seropositive patients, 20 had confirmed SPS spectrum clinically, but 1 was later determined to have a functional neurologic disorder. Sera from 9 patients with SPS spectrum, but not 7 controls, nor the functional patient, caused GlyRalpha1 modulation (100% specificity). SPS spectrum phenotypes included progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) (8), classic SPS (5), stiff limb (5), stiff trunk (1), and isolated exaggerated startle (hyperekplexia, 1). Neuropsychiatric symptoms present in 12 patients (60%) were anxiety (11), depression (6), and delirium (3). Anxiety was particularly severe in 3 patients with PERM. Objective improvements in SPS neurologic symptoms were recorded in 16 of 18 patients who received first-line immunotherapy (89%, 9/10 treated with corticosteroids, 8/10 treated with IVIg, 3/4 treated with plasma exchange, and 1 treated with rituximab). Treatment-sparing maintenance strategies were successful in 4 of 7 patients (rituximab [2/3], azathioprine [1/1], and mycophenolate [1/3]). Conclusions GlyRalpha1-modulating antibody improves diagnostic specificity for immunologically treatable SPS spectrum disorders. Classification of evidence This study provides Class IV evidence that GlyRalpha1-modulating antibody accurately identifies patients with treatable SPS spectrum disorders.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes (PNS) are rare disorders, which are remote effects of cancer that are not caused by the tumor, its metastasis or side effects of treatment. We had nine patients with PNS; two of our patients had limbic encephalitis, but one had autoimmune limbic encephalitis with no malignancy; two patients had subacute cerebellar degeneration; three had Stiff-person syndrome; one had Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome; and the remaining patient had sensory neuronopathy. In most patients, the neurologic disorder develops before the cancer becomes clinically overt and the patient is referred to a neurologist. Five of our patients' malignancies had been diagnosed in our clinic after their neurologic symptoms became overt. PNS are more common than expected and neurologists should be aware of the variety of the clinical presentations of these syndromes. When physicians suspect PNS, cancer screening should be conducted. The screening must continue even if the results are negative.Copyright © 2018 by Turkish Neurological Society

AB  - Objective: Neurologic autoimmune syndromes associated with anti-glutamate acid decarboxylase 65 antibodies (GAD65-Abs) are rare and mostly sporadic. Method(s): We describe a niece and her aunt with GAD65-Abs neurologic syndromes. Highresolution HLA typing of Class I and Class II alleles was performed using next-generation sequencing. Result(s): The proband had cerebellar ataxia and probable limbic encephalitis features, whereas her niece had stiff-person syndrome. Both had a high titer of GAD65-Abs in serum and CSF and showed signs of inflammation in CSF. Both affected members carried the same rare recombinant DRB1*15:01:01~DQA1*01:02:01;DQB1*05:02:01 haplotype, which may or may not be involved in disease susceptibility. Of interest, other unaffected members of the family either had the same HLA haplotype but normal serum GAD65-Abs or had different HLA types but a high titer of serum GAD65-Abs without neurologic symptoms, suggesting cumulative effects. Conclusion(s): This unique association strengthens the concept that hereditary factors, possibly including specific HLA haplotypes, play a role in neurologic syndromes associated with GAD65- Abs.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - We herein describe the successful anesthetic management of a patient with stiff person syndrome undergoing right total hip replacement under spinal anesthesia. We also describe the problems associated with general anesthesia. The advantage of using regional anesthesia in these patients is the avoidance of muscle relaxants. The use of general anesthesia carries the risk of hypotonia in stiff person syndrome postoperatively due to enhancement of y aminobutyric acid (GABA) action on synaptic transmission by drugs that have a gamma GABA agonistic action.Copyright © 2018 College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan.

AB  - Background: Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS)an encephalomyelitis, is an immune-mediated disorder characterized by rigidity of the axial and proximal limb muscles with painful spasThis rare disease responds to immunotherapies and is frequently associated with other autoimmune diseases. More than 80% of SPS patients have autoantibodies to GAD65 and up to 15% have antibodies to glycinereceptor. Neurophysiological studies can help in the diagnosis by demonstrating the presence of continuous motor unit activity at rest, that the patient cannot voluntarily suppress. Material(s) and Method(s): We present a male patient 28 y/o with a history of weight loss, abdominal pain, ortostathic hypotension, ptosis and babinski sign, whith stiffness and painful spasms in both cuadriceps, tibialis anterior, gastronemius, rectus abdominis, thoracic and lumbar paraspinal muscles. Result(s): EMG showed continuous, involuntary activity of normal motor unit potentials. Painful spasms of involuntary muscle activity, were also detected. No other abnormal spontaneus activity such as fibrilations, positive waves, miokimias, high frequency nor myotonic or neuromyotonic discharges were recorded. The SSR was absent en both hands. The Silent period was normal. ENG and SFEMG were normal. Antibodies to glycinereceptors were positive. After treatment with IvIg and plasma exchange the patient had moderate improvement and at present he is on baclofen, diazepam, methylprednisone and levetirazetam, with persistence of fluctuating stiffness and spas. Conclusion(s): The neurophysiological studies play an important role in the differential diagnosis of the diseases associated with excess motor unit activity, leading in this patient to the diagnosis of encephalomyelitis with rigidity, variant of SPS.Copyright © 2019

AB  - Background: Epidemiological studies highlight potential shared pathophysiology, environmental and genetic risk factors for autoimmune disease. Polyautoimmunity is defined as the presence of more than one autoimmune disease in a particular patient and can be found in up to 30% of those with autoimmune diseases. Objective(s): To report a case of seropositive neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and coexistent glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) associated stiff person syndrome (SPS). Method(s): Case report and literature review. Result(s): A 47-year old Caucasian female with pernicious anemia presented with a progressive course of episodic muscle spasms and low back pain, exacerbated by physical activity and emotional stress with normal neuroaxis imaging. Additional testing revealed a serum glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody was positive at greater than 250 IU/mL (normal <5 IU/mL) and she was diagnosed as stiff person syndrome. One- and one-half years later, she had a 2-week episode of ascending numbness to the umbilicus level with asymmetric leg weakness, left greater than right. She was treated with a course of IV methylprednisolone. Her follow up neurologic exam revealed Ashworth grade 1 spasticity in lower extremities, symmetric hyperreflexia with positive Hoffman's sign bilaterally, and decreased pinprick sensation in left lower extremity. Neuroimaging showed a T2 hyperintense expansile cord lesion from C2-C4 and T1-T9 with patchy post-contrast enhancement. MRI brain was unremarkable. CSF testing at the time of transverse myelitis revealed lymphocyte-predominant pleocytosis with normal glucose, protein, IgG index and oligoclonal bands. Serum aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) IgG antibody by cellbased assay was positive with titer 1:10,000. ANA was positive with a titer of 1:640. Extensive infectious, autoimmune, and malignancy screening was unremarkable. She subsequently was treated with rituximab with stabilization of NMO and resolution of SPS symptoms. Her follow up MRIs showed resolution of contrast enhancement. Conclusion(s): This is the first case report to our knowledge of a patient with AQP-4 and GAD antibody positivity and related clinical syndromes. Recognition of complex presentations to guide appropriate evaluation and management is essential.

AB  - Background and aims: Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) is a rare disorder of subacute onset presenting as limb and truncal rigidity, muscle spasms, brainstem signs, and hyperekplexia Lifethreatening, it is part of the spectrum of stiff-person syndrome (SPS) with anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies. Method(s): The case is presented of a previously healthy 38-year-old woman with a rapidly form of PERM developing over 7 months. Result(s): A 38-year-old woman was referred for subacute onset of severe and progressive gait disturbance associated with painful muscular rigidity and spasms of the trunk and lower limbs, unstable posture, followed by involuntary movement of the legs with propagation to myoclonic limb jerks with hyperekplexia. Symptoms appeared 4 months before with few tonic-clonic seizures. Brain and spinal imaging were normal. EEG with theta-delta dysrythmia, evoked potential was normal. Tumor and bone markers were all in referent levels. Anti Aquaporin 4-IgA and IgM, Yo and NMDA receptors antibodies, IgM viral markers, antidsDNA, c-ANCA, ANA, cuprum, ceruloplasmin, were all negative. CSF was negative. Neuropsychological testing did not show any deflection. GAD (glutamate decarbox.) antibodies was 33.6 (<10), and she was also positive to Hu D and Ri antibodies. A first and second cycle of IVIG was completed with good clinical response. Conclusion(s): This case displayed not only the clinical features of PERM, previously associated with both Hu and Ri antibodies, but also some of the features associated with GAD antibodies. This unusual combination of antibodies may be responsible for the particularly progressive course, but good response to IVIG.

AB  - Background and aims: The clinical spectrum of the paraneoplastic anti-Ri syndrome has not been fully defined. We herein report clinical features and outcome in 88 patients with anti-Ri antibodies. Method(s): Retrospective 20-year nationwide study and review of the literature. Result(s): A homogeneous series of 88 patients (33 from the present series and 55 from the literature) is analysed herein. Median age was 65 years (range:35-87); 75% of the patients were women. The frequency of cancer was 81% (59% breast, 17% lung). In 63% of the patients the neurological syndrome preceded the cancer diagnosis; 38% showed a chronic/progressive course. Most common neurological symptoms were: cerebellar syndrome (67%), oculomotor abnormalities (44%), opsoclonus-myoclonus (24%), spasticity (21%) and dystonia (16%). Typically (1/3 of the French series), a subacute gait ataxia was followed by oculomotor abnormalities, and subsequent development of movement disorders (including myoclonus, dystonia, parkinsonism and stiff-person syndrome). The presence of polyneuropathy was significantly associated with the absence of cancer (P<0.05). When a cancer was present, the onset of spasticity and dystonia were significantly associated with breast cancer (P=0.011 and P=0.002, respectively). We expand the spectrum of the disease by describing cases with associated severe dysautonomia and central hypoventilation. Most of the patients were wheelchair bound at 1 year. (Figure presented) Conclusion(s): This is the largest description of paraneoplastic anti-Ri syndrome, (1) a multi-system neurological syndrome with prominent cerebellum/brainstem involvement; (2) opsoclonus-myoclonus is less common than expected; (3) the evolution is often less rapid than that of other PNS; (4) breast cancer is the most common cancer type overall.

AB  - Learning Objective #1: Recognize clinical features and laboratory finding of Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) Learning Objective #2: Identify disorders associated with Stiff Person syndrome CASE: A 37year old female with no significant past medical history presented with refractory stiffness and weakness. Initial symptom started 3 months ago with her right leg giving out while walking. She experienced a fall due to her symptoms, which resulted in fracture left foot. Denied similar episodes in the past. Social history and family history were unremarkable. Patient had unintentional weight loss of 15 pounds in last 4 months. Pap smear within the past year was negative. Review of systems was otherwise negative Vital signs were within normal limits on arrival. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal exam was without abnormalities. Neurological examination revealed mild stiffness; lower extremity stiffness greater than upper extremity; no rigidity. Deep tendon reflexes were 2+; cranial nerves, sensation, cognition were all intact. Breast exam was normal. Initial laboratory findings revealed a normal complete blood count, thyroid studies, comprehensive metabolic, serum vitamin B12, urinalysis, urine drug screen, serum thiamine and autoimmune panel. CT brain and EEG were normal. Her symptoms were attributed to psychogenic non-epileptic seizures and sertraline was initiated. She developed serotonin syndrome due to the addition of Tramadol, trazadone and flexeril to setraline. MRI brain and pan spine revealed T2 hyperintensity within dorsal column in cervical spine and scattered foci on T2 flair within supratentorial white matter. Serum protein electropho-resis, CT chest abdomen pelvis with contrast and lumbar puncture were negative. Paraneoplastic workup revealed elevated titres for amphiphysin antibody indicative of SPS. The patient has since received IV immune globulin and methylprednisolone. Nuclear Medicine PET revealed abnormal nodes in the left axilla and a right upper lung nodule. Left axillary node biopsy was positive for Estrogen receptor carcinoma; suspicious for breast versus gynecologic malignancy. IMPACT/DISCUSSION: This patient had profound stiffness and muscle weakness, which lead to the pursuit of testing for rheumatologic, neurologic, and paraneoplastic etiology Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare, progressive neurolgical syndrome. It is caused by increased muscle activity due to decreased inhibition of the central nervous system. Symptoms include extreme muscle stiffness, rigidity and painful spasms. The syndrome affects twice as many women as men. Treatment aims to control symptoms and improve mobility, involves benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants, and/or intravenous immunoglobulins. Conclusion(s): SPS is associated most commonly with breast cancer but has been linked to Hodgkin's lymphoma and small cell cancer and autoimmune diseases like diabetes mellitis, vitiligo and pernicious anemia. Treatment aims to control symptoms and improve mobility, and may involve benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants, and/or intravenous immunoglobulins.

AB  - Objective: Report an unusual respiratory manifestation of Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS). Background(s): Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) is an uncommon disorder that typically presents with fluctuating muscle rigidity causing painful muscle spasms and in some cases, respiratory distress due to severe respiratory muscle spasms. This patient had a history of GAD antibody positive SPS that presented at age 17 with spells suggestive of seizure, and then represented 2 years later with stiffening of leg musculature and gait difficulty. She was intolerant to multiple treatments including intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and Rituximab. At age 22 she presented acutely with multiple episodes of sustained upward gaze accompanied by jaw clenching and diaphragmatic spasms causing respiratory distress, including cyanosis, requiring oral endotracheal intubation. The jaw clenching episodes obstructed the endotracheal tube. During these spells she appeared to be able to respond, and sometimes tracking upon visual stimuli. On video electroencephalogram (VEEG) there was anterior 10 Hertz (Hz) activity (propofol effect) and intermittent left temporal arrhythmic 1-2 Hz activity with sustained 6-7 cycles-per-second (cps) muscle artifact. No epileptiform activity noted. Even after nasal intubation, she could not be ventilated due to diaphragmatic involvement. She was paralyzed and sedated. She was treated as an inpatient for 6 months with high dose benzodiazepines, and plasmapheresis (ineffective), then IVIg with a decrease in frequency of spells. She was eventually discharged home with a tracheostomy, weekly IVIg, and Diazepam 75 mg every 6 hours (300 mg a day). Her respiratory spells have resolved and her tracheostomy closed. Design/Methods: N/A Results: N/A Conclusion(s): Respiratory involvement in SPS has been previously described, usually as a sensation of dyspnea during muscle spasms. However, to the best of our knowledge, apneic spells associated with diaphragmatic spasms has not been described. It is important to recognize this complication as patients might need early intubation and prompt treatment of SPS manifestations.

AB  - Objective: To describe the clinical and unique radiological features of a patient with Anti-Hu-mediated subacute sensory neuronopathy (SSN) and co-existing stiff person syndrome (SPS). Background(s): Anti-Hu antibodies are associated with paraneoplastic syndromes, classically SSN. We report a patient with a non-paraneoplastic anti-Hu SSN who had selective dorsal column changes on spine MRI. Design/Methods: Case report. Result(s): In 2003, a 57-year-old man presented with body spasms, leg stiffness, and dysphagia. Initial work up demonstrated elevated serum antiGAD65 antibodies, CSF pleocytosis (11 WBCs;87% monocytes) and an unremarkable MRI of neuraxis, body CT, and electrophysiological studies. He improved with pulse steroids. Diagnosis of SPS was made and was put on Mycophenolate (MMF) and monthly IVIG with complete improvement. In 2009, he developed impaired proprioception/vibration/sharp sensation(non-length dependent pattern), gait dysfunction, and diffuse hyporeflexia. Nerve conduction studies revealed absent sensory potentials in multiple nerves but normal motor potentials. He had positive anti-Hu(1:7080) and anti-amphiphysin antibodies(1:15360). Ati-GAD65 antibody was negative. Body PET was negative. MMF was increased, which lead to gait improvement. In 2011, anti-Hu and anti-amphiphysin remained highly elevated. FDG-PET was again negative in 2014. On recent exam, he had severe pinprick/touch/vibration/proprioceptive loss in all extremities(upper>lower), vibratory sensory level at C3, hyporeflexia, and gait ataxia. MRI demonstrated a non-enhancing longitudinally extensive T2-hyperintese lesion(C2-T1) in the dorsal columns. Conclusion(s): Chronic anti-Hu-mediated SSN is associated with dorsal root changes, resembling vitamin B12 deficiency. This is likely caused by secondary degeneration following an initial immune-mediated injury to the dorsal root neurons. This correlates with prior autopsy studies in patients with anti-Hu autoimmunity. Because this process is time-dependent, it's rarely seen on imaging as most patients with anti-Hu autoimmunity die from associated tumors. In our case, cancer was not found. Anti-Hu autoimmunity should be considered in the differential diagnosis of longitudinally extensive dorsal cord myelopathies.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the presence of autoantibodies and their correlation to associated diseases in patients with anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (antiGAD65-ab)-related Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS). Background(s): SPS is a rare disorder that can present with a variety of comorbid autoimmune conditions, the most recognized being type 1 diabetes mellitus and thyroiditis. Due to its rarity, there is lack of knowledge regarding the presence of coexisting autoantibodies and their related comorbid conditions in SPS. Design/Methods: One-hundred and twenty-five antiGAD65-ab positive SPS patients were identified through retrospective review of medical records at Johns Hopkins Hospital from 1997 to 2018. Systemic autoantibodies included anti-thyroid, - gastric parietal cell, -nuclear antibodies, -dsDNA, -Ro, -La, amongst others. Patients without serum testing for systemic autoantibodies were excluded. Also, patients who received IVIG within 12 months of testing for serum autoantibodies were excluded. Result(s): Thirty-nine patients were eligible for this study. Average age of the cohort was 54 years and majority were female (29). Mean serum anti-GAD65 level was 56,647 IU/mL. Thirty-five patients had at least one elevated systemic autoantibody. Most commonly elevated autoantibodies were gastric parietal cell (12 of 19 patients that were tested), anti-nuclear (15 of 38: titer range; 1:80 to >=1:640), Thyroperoxidase (12 of 25), and Thyroglobulin (9 of 35) antibodies. The most commonly comorbid autoimmune conditions were: Autoimmune thyroiditis (n=9), Type 1 Diabetes (n=5), Pernicious anemia (n=4), and Sjogren's syndrome (n=3). One patient had systemic lupus erythematosus. Conclusion(s): This study characterizes the presence of pertinent systemic autoantibodies and related comorbid conditions in a large cohort of individuals with SPS. These findings further support the need to assess for co-existing autoimmune conditions in SPS and helps promote awareness on what autoantibodies may be relevant to check in this patient population.

AB  - Objective: To describe the effects of chronic Rituximab therapy in Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS). Background(s): Rituximab is effective for various neuroimmunologic conditions. Multiple reports suggested efficacy in SPS but a recently published clinical trial was negative. This trial had several limitations including small sample size (12 on active arm), lack of sensitive outcome measures, and importantly it was short in duration. Design/Methods: Data was obtained from more than 150 SPS patients followed at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Demographics, SPS symptoms/signs, pertinent laboratory tests, and timed 25-foot walk (T25FW) were recorded. Data was managed using REDCap and analyzed using Stata15. Result(s): Forty-one patients with SPS were exposed to Rituximab in our cohort. Twenty-three had the minimum information required for analysis. The majority were female(78%) and Caucasian(61%). Average age at first Rituximab infusion was 49 years (range;20-76 years). Mean follow up was 24 months (range;3-60 months). Twenty one patients were antiGAD65 antibody positive SPS, 1 seronegative SPS, and 1 antiGAD-associated pure cerebellar ataxia. Seventeen patients (74%) experienced improvement in SPS symptoms and physical findings. Five had no obvious efficacy and one experienced worsening. Eleven patients (68%) reported improvement in back spasms, 9(70%) in leg spams and 11 (64%) in axial rigidity. Examination showed resolution of axial rigidity in 4 patients (22%), paraspinal muscle spasm in 6 patients (27%) while 6 (25%) patients had an objective improvement in gait. Sufficient T25FW data was available for 12 patients. Mean T25FW at baseline was 9.7 seconds (SD:+/-7.3) which decreased in last visit to 7.4 seconds (+/- 4.2). Five patients (42%) had significant improvement in walking speed defined as >20% change from baseline. Conclusion(s): Long-term Rituximab therapy appears to benefit many patients with SPS. This observed improvement may be related to frequency and/or consistency of treatment. Further studies are needed to better understand what factors are associated with Rituximab treatment responders versus non-responders.

AB  - Objective: Both AMPA and GAD-65 receptor antibodies have been associated with intractable epilepsy, but we report co-occurrence of both antibodies in a patient with stiff person syndrome (SPS) and epilepsy who responded remarkably with immunotherapy. Background(s): A 29-year-old woman with history of a single seizure presented to an outside hospital with abnormal movements in sleep, progressive muscle stiffness and spasms. Routine EEG, MRI brain, and lumbar puncture were performed and were unremarkable. Patient developed illusions of grandeur during THE hospitalization and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and adult-onset scoliosis. Her psychiatric symptoms improved on olanzapine. Patient received a second opinion at our institution 4 months later. Her examination was notable for marked stiffness of the neck and lower extremities with lumbar hyperlordosis. She had impaired gait due to limitation range of motion at her knees related to her stiffness. She had frequent muscle spasms. A 96 hour video EEG revealed 30 electrographic seizures arising in the right parietal region. Serum GAD-65 R antibody returned elevated at >3100 nmol/L (reference range normal <0.02) and AMPA R antibody was also reported as positive (reference range negative) on serum Mayo Autoimmune Encephalopathy panel. Lumbar puncture revealed elevated GAD-65 ab at 80.6 nmol/L (reference range <= 0.02 nmol/L) on the Mayo serum autoimmune encephalopathy panel and >5 oligoclonal bands, but was otherwise was unremarkable. She underwent malignancy workup including US breast, mammogram, CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, and pelvic ultrasound that were negative for malignancy. Design/Methods: N/A Results: She was treated with 2 gm/kg IVIG, diazepam, and lamotrigine with resolution of muscle spasms, improvement of stiffness, but she suffered from fatigue. She received rituximab 500 mg IV x 2 doses and had near complete resolution of symptoms. Conclusion(s): Intractable epilepsy and SPS can co-occur in the context of SPS-plus and be treated with marked improvements with immunotherapies.

AB  - Objective: To report the novel use of bortezomib in refractory stiff person spectrum disorder and discuss the efficacy, treatment protocol and side effects. Background(s): Stiff Person Syndrome is a disorder characterized by fluctuating muscle rigidity along with spontaneous and stimulus-induced painful spasms. Stiff Person Spectrum Disorder (SPSD) is a term used to describe patients with atypical features of SPS. Treatment can be divided into medications that enhance GABA-related activity and immunotherapy. Various immunotherapies have been tried in the past with little data from randomized control trials. Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor that is used in the treatment of multiple myeloma and was used recently in the treatment of refractory NMDA-R encephalitis. Bortezomib decreases both short-lived and long-lived plasma cells which leads to decreased production of circulating antibodies. Possible side effects include neutropenia, anemia, neuropathy, GI upset, LFT derangements, and hypotension. Design/Methods: Review of medical records and literature Results: We report a 58-year-old woman with SPSD with elevated anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody titers in both serum and CSF. Over the course a decade-long disease, the patient suffered from significant disability with axial spasms, stimulus induced spasms and recurrent episodes of vertigo. She failed multiple immunotherapies including plasmapheresis, IVIG, mycophenolate mofetil and rituximab. Given the refractory nature, we chose to use bortezomib as an off-label therapy. Our patient received 5 cycles of subcutaneous bortezomib on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 per cycle followed by a 10-day treatment-free interval. CBC, BMP and LFTs were followed. She developed mild neutropenia after cycle 3 requiring 2-week delay of cycle 4. After treatment completion, she reported improvement with more ability to ambulate and less use of anti-spasmodics. Conclusion(s): Bortezomib seems to be safe in patients with stiff person spectrum disorder and is a promising therapeutic option for those refractory to other immunotherapies.

AB  - Objective: We present a case of a 65-year-old male who initially presented with cerebellar ataxia and myoclonus, and rapidly progressed to rigidity and progressive Encephalomyelopathy, with positive anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies. Patient responded to Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy. Patient ultimately recovered in terms of mentation, rigidity and myoclonus. Background(s): Progressive Encephalomyelitis with Rigidity and Myoclonus (PERM) is a rare subset of Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS), and presents with rigidity, spasms and muscle stiffness. PERM is a chronic disease strongly associated with anti-GAD antibodies and characterized by relapses and remissions. PERM is diagnosed clinically and has been treated with both IVIG and plasmapheresis. Design/Methods: n/a Results: A 65-year-old African American male with medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, status post two kidney transplants (on Tacrolimus), and anoxic brain injury in 2017 with minimal neurology sequel, who presented with two weeks of poor balance and cerebellar ataxia. Within one week of admission patient developed rapidly progressive alteration in level of consciousness, multifocal myoclonic jerks, increased muscle tone and rigidity. Patient remained encephalopathic with severe axial and peduncular stiffness, despite receiving a course of Plasmapheresis. At day 13 after receiving the first course of IVIG, patient showed marked improvement in mental status, stiffness, and rigidity. He improved even further with repeat infusions. The serum anti-GAD65 antibody was consistently elevated (titer: greater than 250 IU/mL). The rest of CSF and serum tests were negative. Three brain MRIs were unremarkable. Complete work ups excluded the presence of malignancy Conclusion(s): We present a case of anti-GAD antibodies positive Progressive Encephalomyelitis with Rigidity and Myoclonus (PERM), who initially presented with cerebellar ataxia, and rapidly progressed to myoclonus and severe stiffness with encephalopathy. Unique features of this case include initial presentation of cerebellar ataxia, immunosuppressed status due to tacrolimus, consistent elevated anti-GAD antibody titers, non-neoplastic and return to baseline following IVIG administration.

AB  - Objective: To report the clinical features of stiff-person spectrum disorder (SPSD). Background(s): SPSD is a collective term encompassing classic stiff-person syndrome (SPS), stifflimb syndrome (SLS), SPS-plus including progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM), and overlapping syndromes. A large cohort study reported that 66.9% of patients with SPSD had neuronal antibodies (GAD65 [43.0%], glycine receptor (GlyR) [19.8%], and others [4.1%]), and patients with GAD65-antibodies had worse outcome than those with GlyR-antibodies or those without neuronal antibodies. Design/Methods: We reviewed the clinical information of 20 patients with clinical feaures of SPSD (median age 48 years [15-80 years], 10 female), who underwent testing for antibodies against neuronal cell-surface antigens (NSAs) in serum and CSF as well as GAD65 and amphiphysin in serum between July 2008 and August 2018. Result(s): The median long-term follow-up was 28.5 months (3.9 to 150 months). Clinical phenotypes included SPS-plus (n=11), SLS (n=5), overlapping syndrome (n=2), and classic SPS (n=2). Only 7 patients (35%) had neuronal antibodies: 5 GlyR (2 with GAD65), 1 AMPAR, GABA(B)R and CV2 associated with thymoma, and 1 GAD65. Three patients had an associated tumor (thymoma, follicular lymphoma, renal cancer), and 1 had a past history of breast cancer. GlyR-antibodies were detected in 3 of 11 patients (27.2%) with SPS-plus, and 2 of 5 patients (40.0%) with SLS. Compared with antibody-negative cases, antibody-positive cases had more frequently CSF oligoclonal bands (3/7 vs 0/11, p=0.0429), but no difference in age of onset, gender, CSF pleocytosis, IgG index, or tumor association. All patients received immunotherapy, but the long-term outcome (defined as modified Rankin Scale <= 2) was better in patients with NSA-antibodies than those without (6/6 vs 4/14, p=0.0108). Conclusion(s): Patients with SPSD and NSA antibodies have better prognosis than those without antibodies.

AB  - Objective: NA Background: Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) is an uncommon disease. Due to the ability to mimic degenerative, immune-mediated, or neoplastic diseases with motor manifestations, it should remain on the differential in many diseases. A previously healthy 44-year-old right handed woman presented with progressive dysarthria and left sided stiffness. She had a history of low back pain. She noticed smaller handwriting, motion sickness, double vision when looked to the left and moving globally slower. Denied cognitive or mood changes. On examination she had normal higher cortical function, had a slow rate of speech with impaired lingual and guttural phonemes. Extraocular movements showed full pursuits and saccades. Optokinetic response and ocular pursuits were slowed in vertical and horizontal directions. Her left arm and left leg were rigid. Finger and toe tapping were slow on the left. Motor strength was full. There was no tremor or ataxia. She was hyperreflexic throughout. Gait was slow and stride length was reduced on the left leg. Her left arm did not swing and adopted a dystonic elbow flexion posture. Pull test was normal (Video). Levodopa trial showed no benefit. Serologic testing resulted positive for GAD65. Design/Methods: NA Results: NA Conclusion(s): Age, unilateral rigidity and motoric slowness suggested a young-onset Parkinson's disease with dystonic features. An atypical parkinsonian disorder such as CBS was also considered given the profound dystonic posturing and asymmetry. Our case highlights the value of keeping SPS on the differential diagnosis of asymmetric rigid syndromes. While classically the disease presents with lumbar bilateral leg rigidity and stiffness, asymmetric limb onset mimicking CBS has been previously described [Balint, et al]. In patients with a possibly akinetic rigid syndrome, a prior history of lumbar back pain, hyperreflexia, and slurred speech may be indicative of SPS in favor of a primary Parkinsonian disorder and should prompt serological testing for GAD65 antibodies.

AB  - Stiff-Person Syndrome (SPS) is a rare disorder that is characterized by stiffness and rigidity of the axial, abdominal, and extremity muscles. It is associated with several autoimmune diseases or paraneoplastic conditions. We report a case of SPS with Hashimoto's thyroiditis who complained of low back pain. Her physical examination was remarkable in that her abdominal and axial muscles were firm to palpation, and she had hyperlordosis of the spine. Active range of motion of the spine was limited, and she had a robotic gait. Electromyography demonstrated continuous motor unit activity in the agonist and antagonist muscles. Diagnosis of SPS was confirmed because antiglutamic acid decarboxylase was present in the cerebrospinal fluid. She favorably responded to intravenous administration of immunoglobulin, diazepam, and baclofen and stretching, strengthening, and range of motion exercises.Copyright © 2015 by Turkish Society of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.

AB  - RATIONALE: Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by progressive muscle stiffness, rigidity, and painful spasms affecting the axial muscles eventually impairing ambulation. Majority (60%) of SPS patients are found to have autoantibody targeting glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), an enzyme involved in synthesis of GABA neurotransmitter. Some cases are idiopathic or neoplasm-related with no antibody detected. In recent studies, serum containing high titer anti-GAD65 antibodies induced motor dysfunction in rats, suggesting antibody functionality. SPS is known to be associated with various other autoimmune conditions (notably type 1 diabetes mellitus) but association with a primary immune deficiency disorder has not been described. METHOD(S): Here we report a case of a middle aged female patient with a history of common variable immunodeficiency well managed on subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) therapy who subsequently developed stiff-person syndrome. EMG findings were indicative of SPS and she tested positive for GAD65 antibodies. RESULT(S): Her SPS symptoms responded to treatment with clonazepam and later levetiracetam. The patient was placed on higher doses of SCIG and her symptoms were greatly ameliorated and physical functionality restored. CONCLUSION(S): More studies of neurological complications of PID and their management are essential.

AB  - Introduction. Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) is a rare immune-mediated neurological disorder. It manifests with limb and axial rigidity, myoclonus, hyperekplexia, brainstem (oculomotor and bulbar), sensory and autonomic disturbances, as well as pyramidal signs. Antibodies (Ab) to the glycine receptor (GlyR) are detected in up to 50% of reported cases. PERM with anti-GlyR Ab is generally associated with a better prognosis than PERM with Ab to glutamic acid decarboxylase. Methods. We report a case of severe PERM with anti-GlyR Ab, which was successfully treated with high-dose corticosteroids (CS), plasma exchanges (PE) and rituximab (RTX). Results. A 68-year-old male presented with sudden-onset nocturnal right ear pain, worsened by any mouth movement. He was unable to eat, but drank sufficiently over the next few days. He came to the emergency room (ER) on day 5 of symptom onset. The ENT specialists diagnosed a right temporo-mandibular joint (TMJ) dislocation. After unsuccessful attempts to relocate the jaw, tizanidine was prescribed. The patient also complained of constipation and difficult micturition. Within a week he developed vertigo and binocular vertical diplopia. Cerebral imaging showed a microvascular leukoencephalopathy. He was started on Aspirin, but returned on day 9 to the ER with an acute confusional state. Upon hospitalization, his condition worsened, with development of hyperthermia, generalized stiffness and jerky movements, requiring intubation, sedation and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). He received vasopressor support for severe autonomic dysfunction. Routine lab work and EEG were unremarkable. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed lymphocytic pleocytosis. Anti-GlyR Ab were detected in both serum and CSF. A whole-body PET-CT was normal. The patient was treated with five PE and five methylprednisolone 1 g pulses, followed by slow CS tapering and two RTX 1 g infusions. Myoclonus and autonomic dysfunction subsided over 1-month period. The patient underwent tracheostomy and was transferred to the neurological ward after a 38-day ICU stay. Further course was characterized by slow but steady reduction of rigidity. Conclusions. PERM in this case started with unilateral TMJ dislocation, followed by diplopia. Within ten days, the patient developed the full-blown neurological picture. The identification of anti-GlyR Ab was crucial for the diagnosis. Immunosuppression led to slow but progressive improvement.

AB  - Stiff Person syndrome is a very rare and severe neuromuscular condition, with a prevalence estimated at 1/1000000. It is characterized by trunk and limb stiffness, painful muscle spasms, having a significant impact on the ability of performing daily activities. The exact cause is not known, now it is considered to be an autoimmune disease. Usually, the onset of the disease symptoms is in the third to fifth decade of life. We present the case of a 44 years old woman, Caucasian, hospitalized for treatment and functional rehabilitation in Medical Rehabilitation Clinical Hospital Baile Felix, Romania. At 36 years she was diagnosed with Stiff Person syndrome on the basis of clinical features, characteristic electromyogram and presence of anti-GAD antibodies. She presented in our clinic for gait difficulty, painful muscle spasms in the legs, unsystematized paresthesias, headache, dorso-lumbar pain, psychic lability. Upon admission, her physical examination revealed the following abnormal data: marked dorsal kyphosis, cervical and lumbar paraspinal muscle contracture, antalgic limited spinal mobility, abolished achilles reflexes, exaggerated patellar tendon reflex, bilateral nystagmus, positive Romberg's test, motor control in legs type proximo-distal controlled mobility, and spastic gait with frequent imbalances. The patient also shows depressive elements. In the absence of pathogenetic treatment, pharmacologic therapies help to control symptoms. Medical rehabilitation targets to reduce spasticity, pain, improve gait and stability.

TI  - Stiff person syndrome: An elusive diagnosis in a pediatric patient
AU  - Tuttrup G.

PD  - /
AB  - Objective: NA Background: Stiff person syndrome is a very rare disorder characterized by axial muscle rigidity, progressive stiffness mainly of the lower extremities and spontaneous, painful spasms of the abdomen, spinal or leg muscles. It is normally reported as being more common in women and affecting adults in their 4 or 5 decade of life. It is very rarely reported in the pediatric literature. Prompt diagnosis of this disease is of great importance due to progressive disability and pain these patients experience and most importantly due to the robust response of this disease to appropriate treatment. A case is presented of a seventeen-year-old male who was diagnosed with stiff person syndrome after one year of symptom onset. Prior to this diagnosis, multiple specialists did extensive testing and focused on symptomatic treatment without determining the underlying etiology. Numerous medical tests were performed including a CK that was mildly elevated, an MRI of the brain and spine that were noncontributory, and a positive ANA. Various medications including baclofen and cyclobenzaprine were minimally effective. On initial presentation to neurology, the patient was dependent upon a walker for mobility, had such extreme stiffness that he had lost the ability to sit upright and was debilitated by painful muscle spasms. On examination, he exhibited rigidity of the abdomen and lower extremities, which appeared to be contracting at rest. Diagnosis was made via EMG of the anterior tibialis, which showed continuous motor unit action potentials while at rest, indistinguishable from voluntary activity. Benzodiazepines and IVIG were initiated. The patient had such a dramatic response to treatment that he was walking independently within one day of treatment. Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase antibody levels resulted as greater than 250 IU/mL. The patient continues to require interval IVIG treatments to prevent symptom recurrence. Design/Methods: NA Results: NA Conclusion(s): NA.

AB  - Objective: describe the safety and utility of botulinum toxin in mitigating muscle spasms/rigidity in Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS). Background(s): SPS is a rare, chronic and disabling disorder that causes marked muscle spasms, stiffness, and rigidity. Persons suffering from SPS may have a varied presentation but, most notably, chronic and disabling muscular spasms which cause significant disability. Pharmacotherapies are often poorly tolerated due to sedation and cognitive impairment. Hence, there is a great unmet need for therapies that not only can help minimize the symptoms of SPS, but also have less potential systemic side effects. Botulinum Toxin, an under-investigated and infrequently used treatment modality, may directly improve muscle spasm and rigidity, thereby improving quality of life. Design/Methods: This observational study included 20 patients with SPS who were longitudinally treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital from 2011-2018. Onabotulinum toxin doses ranged from 100 up to 800 units. Treatment response was determined following injections by patient report; reduction in pain and/or frequency and severity of spasms. We categorized responses qualitatively by poor, moderate and robust response. Side effects were also obtained. Result(s): Amongst the 20 patients, majority were female (85%). Our cohort had varied injection sites, including paraspinals 35%, lower extremity 40%, cervical 10%, hand 5%, and abdominal muscles 5%. Robust response was reported in 30% (6/20), 25% (5/20) reported moderate response, and 40% (8/20) reported poor response amongst which 25% (2/8) had an initial moderate response which abated. Although not consistently recorded, around 25% of our patients were able to decrease their oral medication burden. Among the responders 80% continued with injections. Conclusion(s): In our study, 55% of patients had a positive response to onabotulinum toxin with subjective improvement in spasms and/or pain along with improvement in quality of life. Future studies will be needed to objectively demonstrate the effect of botulinum toxin in SPS.

AB  - Purpose : Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurological disease associated with autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) that causes muscle rigidity and spasms, but vision loss is not typical. We show that autoimmune retinopathy (AIR) associated with anti-GAD65 may be a rare, but debilitating feature of SPS. Methods : Retrospective, chart review, antibody testing by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Results : Patient #1: A 55 year old white female was diagnosed with SPS with anti-GAD autoantibodies. She complained of color vision loss, and vision was 20/40 in both eyes (OU). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed normal macular anatomy. Full field electroretinography (ffERG) showed mild rod dysfunction with isoelectric waveform and attenuation of 30 Hz OU. Multifocal ERG (mfERG) showed macular cone dysfunction OU. At age 57, visual fields were severely constricted to 30 degrees centrally to III4e OU, and ERG showed worsened rod and cone dysfunction OU. She was diagnosed with AIR and monthly intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) was initiated to treat both her SPS and AIR. After 6 months, her fields enlarged to 130 degrees OU. After 9 months, her mfERG amplitudes normalized OU, and her ffERG improved OU. Patient #2: A 37 year old white female was diagnosed with SPS with anti-GAD autoantibodies. At age 62, she presented with a history of AIR and severe cone-rod dysfunction on ffERG, and was already on IVIg for SPS. She had hand-motion vision, severe macular attenuation on OCT, and worsened constriction of visual fields down to small peripheral islands OU. She was diagnosed with actively progressive AIR and her monthly IVIg dose was increased. After 3 months on high-dose IVIg, her V4e isopters enlarged by nearly 9 times OD and 3 times OS. Western blotting showed a presence of anti-GAD65 autoantibodies, and immunohistochemistry using human donor retina showed staining of the inner nuclear layer, inner plexiform layer and ganglion cell layer in both patients, which was consistent with the retinal staining pattern specific to anti-GAD65 antibodies. Conclusions : We demonstrate that AIR in patients with SPS with anti-GAD autoantibodies can cause rod-cone degeneration with peripheral field loss or cone-rod degeneration with macular attenuation and central vision loss. AIR in these two cases benefited from IVIg therapy, further supporting that AIR is an antibody-mediated disease.

AB  - Objective: Characterize the clinical features and vestibulo-ocular function of patients with anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (anti-GAD65) associated neurologic disorders who were referred for evaluation from Neuro-ophthalmology or Neurotology. Background(s): Anti-GAD65 associated neurologic disorders are rare. The most recognized is Stiff-person syndrome (SPS), but other phenotypes have been described, such as cerebellar ataxia and brainstem manifestations. Design/Methods: Retrospective review of medical records from 1997 to 2018 at Johns Hopkins Hospital revealed 170 patients with diagnosis of SPS or anti-GAD65 associated neurologic disorder, of which eight (4.7%) were referred for neurologic evaluation by Neuro-ophthalmology or Neurotology. Video-oculography (VOG) was used to analyze ocular motor and vestibular function that was consistent with posterior fossa involvement. Result(s): Three patients were referred from Neuro-ophthalmology and five from Neurotology. Symptoms for which patients were initially seen included diplopia, vertigo, and dizziness. Four additionally exhibited ataxia. Average age was 62 years (range: 49-77) and average time to diagnosis was 5.6 years. The majority were male and Caucasian. Four had coexisting autoimmune conditions. None had a paraneoplastic etiology. All had elevated anti-GAD65 antibodies in serum. Six had CSF studies, of which five showed elevated anti-GAD65 antibodies. VOG was performed in seven, with findings of: spontaneous nystagmus (seven, one with fixation and six with it removed), positional nystagmus (five), saccadic pursuit (four), skew deviation (three), hyperventilation induced nystagmus (three), abnormal vestibulo-ocular reflex suppression (three), abnormal head impulse testing (three), and gaze evoked nystagmus with rebound (two). Seven received immunotherapy, all of whom reported functional improvement. Five received symptomatic therapy, four of whom reported functional improvement. Conclusion(s): Besides SPS, other phenotypes of anti-GAD65 associated disorders are increasingly recognized. Brainstem abnormalities can be further characterized on VOG. Ocular and vestibular symptoms may prompt initial evaluation by other specialties. Hence, further inter-disciplinary education and collaboration may help increase awareness of these less-recognized symptoms and facilitate earlier diagnosis.

AB  - Objective: To describe the UK experience of assessing patients with Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) for Autologous Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (Auto-HSCT). Background(s): SPS is a rare immune-mediated neurological disorder characterised by muscle rigidity, spasms and high GAD antibodies. Auto-HSCT has previously been used to treat limited numbers of patients. Design/Methods: Between 2015-2018, 7 patients with SPS were referred to our institution from the UK and Finland for auto-HSCT. One patient was found to be stable and was declined treatment and six were deemed suitable for autograft. Three patients have been treated. Patient 1 had the Progressive Encephalomyelitis with Rigidity and Myoclonus (PERM) variant of SPS. Patients 2 and 3 had classical SPS. All patients were significantly disabled and had failed multiple immunotherapies including intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and plasmapheresis. They were mobilised with Cyclophosphamide (Cy) 2g/m2 + G-CSF and conditioned with Cy 200mg/kg + ATG followed by auto-HSCT as per EBMT Guidelines. A fourth patient is scheduled for auto-HSCT and two patients are awaiting funding approval. Result(s): Despite their significantly reduced performance status, all 3 patients tolerated the procedure with routine toxicities. Patient 1 - post-transplant assessments showed disease 'stabilisation' and his anti-GAD titre normalised. His IVIG was discontinued. At 12 months, MR spectroscopy showed significant increase in the NAA/Cr ratio. Patient 2 - post-transplant assessments showed marked improvement but her anti-GAD titre remained high. She required no further IVIG dosing. At 12 months, her neurophysiological assessment showed improvement. Patient 3 - post-transplant assessments showed marked improvement and anti-GAD titre normalised. She required no further IVIG dosing. At 3 months, Her neurophysiological assessment showed marked improvement. Conclusion(s): Auto-HSCT is an effective treatment option in patients with severe SPS. The best results are seen in patients with the classical phenotype. Further work is warranted to optimise patient selection and establish the efficacy, long-term safety, and cost-effectiveness of this treatment.

AB  - A follow-up of a 59-year-old female patient with stiff person syndrome in combination with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and autoimmune thyroiditis is presented in this work. The disease was manifested by characteristic movement disorders such as stiffness and painful spasms of the abdominal muscles, back and hips, accompanied by impaired walking and frequent falls. It was noted that the erector spinae muscle was involved in the pathological process, the muscle biopsy revealed a decrease in the content of the sarcomere proteins, titin and nebulin. In the course of pathogenetic GABAergic drug therapy, movement disorders became less marked however anxiety and phobic disorders prevailed, that was manifested as gait disorder because of the fear to fall and led to diagnosis of social phobia in the patient. The therapy of nonmotor symptoms of stiff person syndrome and significance of cognitive-behavioral therapy for reducing symptoms of anxiety disorders are discussed.Copyright © 2019, Pharmainfo Publications.

AB  - Anti-Glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GAD) are increasingly diagnosed in the clinic and this antibody related syndromes can manifest commonly as autoimmune encephalitis, Stiff person syndrome and cerebellar ataxia. However, it is unclear if the race has role in age of incidence, presentation and severity of symptoms of anti-GAD associated conditions. In our cohort of 40 patients who were anti-GAD positive, we observed that the age at which the anti-GAD titers turned out to be positive was significantly lower in African Americans (AA) compared to Caucasians (Cau) irrespective of the type of conditions. However, the age at symptoms onset didn't differ significantly different between these groups. Furthermore, AA anti-GAD positive patients had seizures as their initial presentation that was significantly higher in incidence compared to Cau indicating that AA have more aggressive form of autoimmune phenomenon for reasons unknown. Future studies to explore the variations in autoimmune process and their phenotypes may aid in understanding anti-GAD syndromes differently between these racial groups.Copyright © 2019

AB  - Stiff person syndrome is a rare neurologic disorder characterised by rigidity of the truncal and proximal limb muscles with intermittent superimposed spasms. It's unique because it lacks similarity to any other neurologic disorder. Possibly tetanus is the closest related condition with both inhibiting central gamma-aminobutyric (GABA) systems. Stiff person syndrome is extremely rare with less than 20 cases reported from South Asia which has a population of nearly 2 billion. In its classic form, it is associated with the presence of high titres of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies. Paraneoplastic stiff person syndrome comprising of around 5% of the patients has been reported with malignancies of the breast, colon, lung, thymus and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Antibodies against amphiphysin and gephyrin are detected in paraneoplastic stiff person syndrome. We report a 58 year old Sri Lankan male with stiff person syndrome with a high GAD antibody titre and classical electromyographic changes, who was found to have an underlying carcinoid tumour. We postulate that stiff person syndrome was a paraneoplastic phenomenon secondary to the carcinoid in this case. Although neurological syndromes such as sensory neuropathy, limbic encephalitis and, myelopathy have been described as paraneoplastic features in carcinoid, we believe this is the first report of stiff person syndrome associated with carcinoid tumour.Copyright © 2019, Brazilian Association of Computational Mechanics.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare and disabling neurological disorder of autoimmune origin, characterized by progressive stiffness and muscle spasms affecting the axial and limb muscles, most frequently associated with antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase. We describe a patient who presented initially with compartment syndrome and was later diagnosed with SPS.This is the first case report of SPS possibly presenting initially with compartment syndrome. This case illustrates the importance of recognizing that patients with SPS may present with varied manifestations, including compartment syndrome, which by itself is a medical emergency.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) and its subtype, stiff limb syndrome (SLS), are rare neurological disorders characterized by progressive muscular rigidity and spasms. Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) is the enzyme that catalyzes the production of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a major inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system. SPS is an autoimmune disease triggered by antiglutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (anti-GAD Ab). Clinically, anti-GAD Ab is associated with SPS, type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and other autoimmune diseases. AIM To investigate the link of autoimmune endocrine disorders with anti-GAD Ab in SPS subjects. METHODS This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan. We collected the patients with SPS from January 2001 to June 2018. By reviewing 14 patients from medical records, we analyzed the clinical findings with coexisting autoimmune diseases, particularly diabetes mellitus and thyroid disease, which are associated with anti- GAD antibody titers or other immunological test results (anti-thyroid peroxidase and anti-nuclear antibodies). We also evaluated malignancies, major complications, and reported treatment to improve symptoms. Anti-GAD antibodies were measured using radioimmunoassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The cut-off values of these tests are < 1 U/mL and < 5 U/mL, respectively. RESULTS The median age of all patients was 39.3 (range, 28.0-54.0) years with a median follow-up period of 6.0 (2.7-13.3) years. Five (35.7%) patients were female; twelve (85.7%) were diagnosed with classic SPS and two (14.3%) with SLS. The median age of onset of symptoms was 35.0 (26.0-56.0) years with a median follow-up duration of 9.0 (2.1-14.9) years in the classic SPS group; the SLS group had a median age of onset of 46.7 years and a shorter follow-up duration of 4.3 years. Among nine classic SPS patients who underwent the anti-GAD Ab test, three were anti-GAD Ab seropositive and each of these three patients also had T1DM, latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, and autoimmune thyroid disease, respectively. In contrast, other rare autoimmune diseases co-existed in six anti- GAD Ab seronegative SPS patients. None of the SLS patients had additional autoimmune diseases. CONCLUSION While typical clinical symptoms are crucial for the diagnosis of SPS, the presence of anti-GAD autoantibody may consolidate the diagnosis and predict the association with other autoimmune diseases.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune neuromuscular disorder that impairs GABAergic inhibition of skeletal muscle. It is a debilitating disease that leads to muscle rigidity, spasms and poor quality of life. The syndrome is managed symptomatically with GABA agonists while clinical trials of immunoglobulin and rituximab have shown promise of longer lasting relief. We present a case of Stiff Person Syndrome in a 38-year old Filipina presenting with two years' history of progressive axial and peripheral muscle rigidity. There were associated painful spasms triggered by startling visual, auditory and tactile stimuli. Physical examination showed rigidity of the neck, back, abdomen, arms and legs. The rest of the neurologic examination was unremarkable. Blood examinations showed diabetes mellitus and elevated anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase titers (1,708 IU/mL, cut-off >5 IU/mL). Surface electromyography demonstrated continuous involuntary activation of the lumbar paraspinals, rectus abdominis and sternocleidomastoids (Figure 1). There was no myotonia, neuromyotonia or denervation changes.[Figure presented] Imaging of the brain and spine was normal. Electroencephalogram did not show any epileptiform discharges. Screening for malignancies was unremarkable. There was short-term reduction in stiffness with clonazepam (2 mg/tab 1 tab thrice daily), but titration was limited by dose-dependent somnolence. Intravenous immunoglobulin (2 g/kg over 5 days) provided further reduction in stiffness and improved quality of life for as long as three months after infusion. No adverse events were encountered.Copyright © 2019

AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurologic disorder characterised by rigidity of the truncal and proximal limb muscles with intermittent superimposed spasms. It's unique because it lacks similarity to any other neurologic disorder. Possibly tetanus is the closest related condition with both inhibiting central gamma-aminobutyric (GABA) systems. SPS is extremely rare with less than 20 cases reported from South Asia which has a population of nearly 2 billion. In its classic form, it is associated with the presence of high titres of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies. Paraneoplastic SPS comprising of around 5% of the patients has been reported with malignancies of the breast, colon, lung, thymus and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Antibodies against amphiphysin and gephyrin are detected in paraneoplastic SPS. We report a 58 year old Sri Lankan male with SPS with a high GAD antibody titre and classical electro myographic (EMG) changes, who was found to have an underlying carcinoid tumour. We postulate that SPS was a paraneoplastic phenomenon secondary to the carcinoid in this case. Although neurological syndromes such as sensory neuropathy, limbic encephalitis and, myelopathy have been described as paraneoplastic features in carcinoid, we believe this is the first report of SPS associated with carcinoid tumour.Copyright © 2019

AB  - Stiff person syndrome is a rare neurological syndrome characterized by fluctuating muscle rigidity and painful spasms. About 5-8% of stiff person syndrome cases are associated with malignant tumors, and the symptoms can manifest as a para-neoplastic disorder. Case. We herein report a 68-year-old man who was referred to our hospital with a chief complaint of gait disturbance due to painful muscle rigidity in both legs. Examinations of the head and spine showed no abnormalities. However, on chest computed tomography, an anterior mediastinal tumor was seen, and blood tests showed a high titer of anti-glutamic acid decarbox-ylase antibody. These findings suggested that his symptoms could be attributed to paraneoplastic neurological syndrome associated with the mediastinal tumor. Furthermore, characteristic symptoms and laboratory findings also indicated stiff person syndrome. These symptoms were not affected by initial treatment with ster-oids, but they were improved by benzodiazepine and ba-clofen treatment. The pathological diagnosis after radical thymectomy was type B2 thymoma. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. His medications were decreased, and his symptoms gradually improved. Conclusion. Thymectomy might offer symptomatic relief for stiff person syndrome associated with thymoma.Copyright © 2019 The Japan Lung Cancer Society

AB  - Stiff-Person Syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurologic disorder characterized by severe and progressively worsening muscle stiffness and rigidity. SPS can be very painful due to unpredictable muscle spasms which can be triggered by various stimuli, such as noise, touch, or emotional experiences. There is thought to be an autoimmune component to the disorder. We present the case of a 59-year-old woman diagnosed with SPS who appears to have experienced a dramatic reduction in her symptoms after being treated with Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN). Prior to this treatment regimen, she had tried many treatments with only limited derived benefit. She was started on LDN and after 6 weeks, reported reductions in pain, anxiety, depression, agoraphobia, and muscle tightness. Upon multiple follow-ups, leading up to 12 months, she continually displayed reduced symptoms and improved quality of life. We conclude that LDN may have some utility in treating and managing the symptoms of SPS. We hypothesize that this may be possible due to LDN operating via anti-inflammatory pathways as well as acting as an opioid antagonist. We assert that further research as it relates to LDN and SPS in addition to other chronic pain conditions is warranted.Copyright © 2020

AB  - The majority of patients with stiff person-syndrome (SPS) are characterized by autoantibodies to glutamate decarboxylase 65 (GAD65). In previous passive-transfer studies, SPS immunoglobulin G (IgG) induced SPS core symptoms. We here provide evidence that SPS-IgG causes a higher frequency of spontaneous vesicle fusions. Sustained GABAergic transmission and presynaptic GABAergic vesicle pool size remained unchanged. Since these findings cannot be attributed to anti-GAD65 autoantibodies alone, we propose that additional autoantibodies with so far undefined antigen specificity might affect presynaptic release mechanisms. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Wien.

AB  - In this report we present a clinical case of trismus. The patient in question showed symptoms of trismus for 3 days, rapidly leading to respiratory insufficiency. Afterwards she developed myoclonus and progressive encephalopathy. Neurological workup showed no relevant abnormalities. A CT of the abdomen revealed a mass in the lower abdomen, which turned out to be an ovarian teratoma. Progressive encephalopathy with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) was diagnosed clinically. Treatment with corticosteroids, benzodiazepines, and levetiracetam did not ameliorate the patient's condition. Only after the introduction of plasmapheresis was there a spectacular improvement in her clinical state. In this case we could not detect associated antibodies. The most likely cause of PERM is paraneoplastic disease secondary to ovarian teratoma. This type of tumor has been associated with multiple paraneoplastic neurological conditions, but this is the first case associated with PERM. To date there is only one publication on trismus as a sole presenting sign, with a quite similar disease course.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Objective: Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is usually characterized by truncal muscle rigidity and episodic painful spasms, but it sometimes appears with ocular symptoms called "stiff eyes". We recorded saccade movements in an SPS patient manifesting with "stiff eyes" conditions with slow saccade velocity and evaluated the effect of immunotherapy including rituximab on saccade parameters. Method(s): We repeatedly conducted saccade eye recordings using video-based eye tracking system on a 42-year-old male SPS patient with slow saccade. The velocity and onset latency of visual guided saccades (VGS) were measured at each recording. Because VGS velocity is affected by saccade amplitude, estimated peak velocity (Vmax) was also calculated by taking the relationship between the velocity and the amplitude of saccade into account. Result(s): The mean VGS velocity improved significantly after two courses of rituximab administration compared with its lowest value. The estimated Vmax decreased as the clinical manifestations worsened, but it increased after rituximab administration. Other neurological symptoms in this patient such as muscle rigidity and gait instability also improved after the treatment. Conclusion(s): Slow saccade in a "stiff eyes" patient improved after rituximab administration. Our study also indicated that the saccade eye recording is useful for evaluating the clinical condition of SPS when it is complicated with ocular symptoms.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Anti-GAD antibody syndrome is a result of the production of antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the main enzyme responsible for the production of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Several neurological manifestations including cerebellar ataxia and stiff person syndrome have been reported in association with anti-GAD antibodies. In this paper, we present a case of a young woman with anti-GAD antibodies who initially presented with cerebellar ataxia followed by stiff person syndrome three and a half years later. Having both cerebellar ataxia and stiff person syndrome is a rare occurrence in anti-GAD antibody syndrome. We emphasise the importance of long-term follow-up of patients with anti-GAD antibody syndrome, as delayed neurological manifestations can occur.Copyright © 2020 Sinali O. Seneviratne et al.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe 2 cases from a single academic institution of improvement in stiff-person syndrome (SPS) symptoms during pregnancy and to review the clinical outcomes of SPS in 6 additional pregnancies described in the literature. METHOD(S): Evaluation of clinical symptoms and treatment changes of disease state during pregnancy. RESULT(S): Seven patients with 9 pregnancies are described in women with a diagnosis of SPS. Six of 7 (86%) women were positive for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) antibody. In 5 of 9 (56%) pregnancies, symptomatic medications (antispasmodics) were significantly reduced with stabilization or improvement in symptoms through pregnancy. Nine live, healthy pregnancies resulted. All 7 (100%) women experienced worsening of symptoms after the birth of their children, and symptomatic therapies were resumed and/or increased. CONCLUSION(S): The immune pathogenesis of SPS continues to be explored. Immunomodulatory shifts during pregnancy may influence changes of clinical SPS symptoms and provide insight into the unique pathogenesis of SPS. Some women with SPS may be able to reduce symptomatic medications related to clinical improvement during pregnancy. Women with SPS may safely carry pregnancies to term, delivering healthy and unaffected babies.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (anti-GAD65) are associated with a number of neurologic syndromes. However, their pathogenic role is controversial. Our objective was to describe clinical and paraclinical characteristics of anti-GAD65 patients and analyze their response to immunotherapy. METHOD(S): Retrospectively, we studied patients (n = 56) with positive anti-GAD65 and any neurologic symptom. We tested serum and CSF with ELISA, immunohistochemistry, and cell-based assay. Accordingly, we set a cutoff value of 10,000 IU/mL in serum by ELISA to group patients into high-concentration (n = 36) and low-concentration (n = 20) groups. We compared clinical and immunologic features and analyzed response to immunotherapy. RESULT(S): Classical anti-GAD65-associated syndromes were seen in 34/36 patients with high concentration (94%): stiff-person syndrome (7), cerebellar ataxia (3), chronic epilepsy (9), limbic encephalitis (9), or an overlap of 2 or more of the former (6). Patients with low concentrations had a broad, heterogeneous symptom spectrum. Immunotherapy was effective in 19/27 treated patients (70%), although none of them completely recovered. Antibody concentration reduction occurred in 15/17 patients with available pre- and post-treatment samples (median reduction 69%; range 27%-99%), of which 14 improved clinically. The 2 patients with unchanged concentrations showed no clinical improvement. No differences in treatment responses were observed between specific syndromes. CONCLUSION(S): Most patients with high anti-GAD65 concentrations (>10,000 IU/mL) showed some improvement after immunotherapy, unfortunately without complete recovery. Serum antibody concentrations' course might be useful to monitor response. In patients with low anti-GAD65 concentrations, especially in those without typical clinical phenotypes, diagnostic alternatives are more likely.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Epilepsy should be suspected in patients with Stiff-person syndrome and new onset paroxysmal episodes. Musicogenic epilepsy may be a manifestation of anti-GAD-Ab spectrum, supporting an autoimmune workup in these patients. Appropriate treatment is not well established, and immunotherapy should be considered in patients with only partial response to antiepileptic drugs.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stiff person spectrum disorder is a group of rare conditions clinically characterized by the core symptoms of fluctuating muscular stiffness with superimposed spasms and an exaggerated startle response (hyperkplexia). It includes multiple variants amongst which are focal forms like stiff limb syndrome. Up to date, it was described in association with a spectrum of antibodies interfering with gabaergic transmission, most frequently antibodies targeting GAD, glycine receptor, amphiphysin and more rare dipeptidylpeptidase like protein 6, gephyrin, GABAAR and Glycine transporter 2. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We report the case of a stiff limb syndrome associated to anti-NMDAR antibodies. The patient, a French 44-year male, with no antecedents presents with a 2-month history of painful spasms in his both legs resulting in a difficulty of walking and multiple falls. The diagnosis was supported by a stiff limb syndrome clinical pattern, a clinical response to treatment with benzodiazepines and baclofen and by the absence of other neurological finding that could have suggested an alternative diagnosis. RESULT(S): Anti NMDA-R antibodies were identified in blood and CSF samples using both immunofluorescence and cell-based assay. Any other intracellular and surface antibodies were negatives, GAD-ab included. Oncological evaluation was negative. The patient didn't present encephalopathy signs and neuropsychological evaluation was normal. The patient received immunotherapy with one cure of intravenous immunoglobulins after an only partial improvement with symptomatic treatment. CONCLUSION(S): This is the first case report of an association between the anti NMDA-R and stiff limb syndrome. Further investigations are needed to provide a better understanding of the pathophysiology of stiff person spectrum disorders.

AB  - Background: Movement disorders in anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (anti-GAD Ab) include stiff-person syndrome (SPS), progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus, cerebellar ataxia, and opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome. Parkinsonism is a rare presentation of anti-GAD Ab syndromes. Objective(s): To report the anti-GAD Ab positive patient who presented with parkinsonism and SPS with a good response to immunomodulators. Method(s): A 66-year-old Thai woman presented with progressive gait difficulty for 2 years. She was diagnosed with prediabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. She did not take any dopamine-blocking agents. Gait difficulty was described as "robotic gait" concomitantly with postural instability. She developed whole body slowness in the past 3 months. At our hospital, the patient showed marked stiffness of paraspinal muscles with limited truncal flexion, extension, and rotation. During walking, her legs and trunk became stiff. Bradykinesia also presented on her both hands and feet without tremor. Her cerebellar functions were normal and she did not have a motor weakness. Result(s): Her cranial and whole spinal MRI were normal. Serum paraneoplastic profile,thyroid antibodies and antinuclear antibody were tested. Only anti-GAD Ab was positive. The patient was treated with plasma exchange, prednisolone, and azathioprine. One month later, all symptoms were markedly improved. Conclusion(s): Parkinsonism can be one of manifestations of anti-GAD Ab syndrome. Early recognition and prompt treatment will provide a favorable outcome.

TI  - Stiff Limb Syndrome Masquerading As a Focal Limb Dystonia
AU  - Morrison P.

AB  - Objective: To report a case of immune-mediated stiff limb syndrome referred for extremity focal dystonia. Background(s): Autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are associated with multiple neurological disorders, most commonly cerebellar ataxia and stiff-person syndrome (SPS). [1] Antibodies to GAD are also commonly seen in other immunologic disorders, such as type I Diabetes Mellitus (DM). A more rare clinical subtype of SPS, stiff-limb-syndrome, can occur in ~10-15% of cases, and typically presents with focal involvement of a lower limb with sparing of the trunk muscles. Method(s): The patient is a 33 y/o male with a PMH of type 1 DM who presented with subacute onset (months) of abnormal movement involving the right foot, ankle, and toes with associated pain, discomfort, and stiffness. His neurologic exam was notable for persistent right great toe extension at the MTP joint and great toe flexion at the interphalangeal joint. Digits 2-5 also showed increased flexion, but to lesser extent. His tone was increased in the distal RLE most consistent with rigidity, particularly at the ankle. Otherwise his neurologic exam showed no other focal deficits. Result(s): MRI brain with and without contrast showed no focal intracranial abnormalities. EMG/NCS of the L3-S1 sampled muscles of the right lower extremity found inability to fully silence the flexor hallucis longus and extensor hallucis longus muscles. Laboratory evaluation was positive for serum GAD antibodies (>250.0; normal 0-5). Lumbar puncture showed positive CSF GAD65 antibodies (2.30; normal range <0.02), 1 oligoclonal band (normal 0-1), slightly elevated glucose (91; normal 50-80), normal IgG Index (0.52; normal 0.28-0.66), normal protein (22; normal 15-45), and no cellular infiltrate. CT chest/abdomen/pelvis showed no clear underlying malignancy. The patient was treated with low dose clonazepam 0.5mg BID and has noted a significant symptomatic improvement in his lower extremity spasm, pain, and stiffness. Conclusion(s): We report a case of stiff-limb-syndrome referred for evaluation for a focal lower extremity dystonia and pain associated with positive serum and CSF anti-GAD antibodies in a patient with type 1 DM. Even though this entity is rare, it is still important to consider anti-GAD antibody in the differential diagnosis of a focal dystonia with associated pain in a young patient of subacute-to-chronic onset, especially with a history of type 1 DM.

AB  - Objective: To extend spectrum of glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) associated disorders by reporting a case Background: GADA associated disorders include a broad and clinically heterogeneous group of conditions. Among them, stiff-person syndrome (SPS),cerebellar ataxia(CA) and limbic encephalopathy(LE) are common neurologic presentation. So far, more and more cases have showed that multiple neurologic syndromes could occur with anti-GADA,-which can coexist in a single patient with different kinds of combination. Method(s): A 29-year-old Chinese woman presented with paroxysmal numbness in left-sided limbs, slight memory loss and stiffness in trunk 22 months prior to admission,followed by gait problems and stiffness in left leg in 1 year.Neurological examination showed slight impairment of memory and calculation. Muscle tone increased in left limbs with predominance in left lower limb. Pathological signs were not noted. A stiff,split-step gait and disturbances of initiating left lower limb were present. Accompanied movements in left arm reduced during walking. Cranial nerve function, muscle strength and sensory examination were normal. No ataxia was present. No specific history was noted. EEG demonstrated spikes in frontal and temporal lobes with T2/T2flair hyperintensities in bilateral hippocampi on brain MR. EMG demonstrated continuous motor unit activity in left sacrospinal muscle and left rectus abdominis. A titer of 1:320 GAD65 was identified in both serum and CSF. Other antibodies such as NMDA, AMPA1, AMPA2, GABA2,LGI-1 and CASPR-2 was negative. Tumor markers,organic acids,ANA and ENA related autoimmune antibodies were absent.Seizures and motor symptoms relieved after treatment of IVIG and continuous glucocorticoid. Titer of GAD65 in serum decreased to 1:100 during follow-up. Result(s): We diagnose the patient as GADA associated neurological syndrome presenting with limbic encephalitis and stiff-person syndrome, which responded to IVIG and glucocorticoid. Conclusion(s): LE and SPS associated with anti-GADA could coexist and respond to immunomodulatory therapy.

TI  - Stiff Limb Syndrome Progressing to Stiff Man Syndrome in a nondiabetic man
AU  - Ali T.

AU  - Guduru Z. 
PY  - 2019
PD  - /
AB  - Objective: Stiff person syndrome is a rare CNS disorder characterized by fluctuating muscle rigidity of truncal and proximal limb muscles with superimposed painful spasms. Involved muscles most often include the paraspinal, abdominal, and occasionally proximal leg musculature. Most patients have anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies in serum. Background(s): We present a case of non-diabetic man with stiff limb syndrome who progressed to stiff person syndrome. Method(s): A 52-year-old male from the Congo presented with a 2-year history of stiffness of the right lower extremity and abdomen. He described progressive difficulty with ambulation, and over time required the use of a walker. He denied any associated pain, sensory disturbance, urinary or bowel symptoms. His family history was unremarkable. There was marked rigidity in both lower extremities, right greater than left. His reflexes were normal, and sensation was intact across all modalities. His gait was broad-based and cautious. His knee was notably rigid without any degree of flexion while ambulating, and his toes remained curled. His abdominal muscles were stiff and prominent. Result(s): Laboratory testing for CBC, CMP, A1c, RPR, HTLVI/II, HIV, Vitamin B12, Vitamin E, Folate, and Creatine Kinase were all normal. His anti-Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase (GAD) antibody however was markedly elevated at greater than 50,000. HbA1c was in normal range. A CT abdomen and pelvis revealed no evidence of neoplastic disease. After initiation of diazepam 15mg/ day, his symptoms significantly improved and was able to walk without assistance, could flex at the knees, and participate in physical therapy. His toes, which were initially curled on the right foot had released, except at the great toe. Conclusion(s): We present a non-diabetic case of Stiff limb syndrome who progressed to stiff person syndrome with a high anti-GAD antibody level. Though the hallmark diagnostic sign remains the presence of hyperlordosis and co-contractures of the abdominal wall and thoracic paraspinal muscles, our patient did not present with any of these features. There was a significant improvement with benzodiazepine.

AB  - Objective: To delineate the characteristics and distinguishing features of functional stiff person-like disorders (fSPLD). Background(s): Stiff person spectrum disorders (SPSD) are a group of rare autoimmune disorders, characterised by fluctuating stiffness, spasms, and hyperekplexia. The presentation of SPSD - the wooden, stiff-legged gait, the fear of walking unaided, the fluctuating nature of stiffness, and often the lack of other, "objective neurological signs" - can appear "bizarre" and leads frequently to an erroneous diagnosis of a functional neurological disorder. Conversely, we have seen several patients with functional "stiff-personlike" phenotypes, which were erroneously diagnosed and treated as organic SPSD. Method(s): Retrospective dual-site case-control notes review of fSPLD with matched SPSD patients as controls. Participants were recruited from 2 centres (London and Heidelberg). fSPLD patients have been referred with a suspected diagnosis of SPSD. fSPLD was defined by the diagnostic criteria for a clinically definite functional movement disorder. Result(s): From 2014-2018, we (BB, KB) have seen 13 patients with a suspected diagnosis of SPSD. Four patients had in fact fSPLD, thus accounting for one third of referrals in one tertiary referral centre. Similar to organic SPSD where there are forms with dominant stiffness and predominantly myoclonic forms ("jerking stiff man"), we saw two main and equally frequent phenotypes in fSPLD: half of the patients had stiffness and spasms as main presentation; in the other half, stimulus-sensitive jerks and exaggerated startle were the dominating features. Some of the stiffperson core symptoms reported or exhibited by fSPLD patients resembled those seen in organic SPSD, such as a stiff legged-gait, trunk extension or opisthotonus during attacks, and painful spasms. Clinical characteristics particular to fSPLD included a "flexion pattern" of stiffness, functional jerks, or a co-contracting tremor. Additional functional symptoms (i.e., a functional gait disorder or speech disorder, dissociative disorder) were present in two thirds of the patients. Conclusion(s): fSPLD represent a relevant differential diagnosis. Knowledge of the clinically distinguishing features and the role of ancillary testing is key for distinguishing fSPLD from SPSD, and initiating the appropriate treatment.

AB  - Background: Stiff-limb syndrome is part of stiff person spectrum, presenting with fluctuating gait disorders attributed to leg stiffness, spasms, and posturing. It could also manifest with anxiety and specific phobias such as pseudoagoraphobia. We aimed to describe the importance of specific gait phobia as a diagnostic clue to anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase stiff-limb syndrome. Cases: We reported on 2 cases of stiff-limb syndrome sharing a similar diagnostic path and phenomenology. Both were featured by pseudoagoraphobia, which has documented to typically cover organic conditions, and a remarkable diagnostic delay attributed to misdiagnoses. Presence of pseudoagoraphobia should not point to the diagnosis of a functional disorder-although a negative instrumental workup is documented. Conclusion(s): Both cases are emblematic of the high misdiagnosis rate affecting stiff person syndrome patients. A proper diagnostic process, including the identification of a pseudoagoraphobia, should help in reaching a diagnosis and providing an early and effective treatment.Copyright © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society

AB  - Objective: To demonstrate the clinical characteristics of stiff-person syndrome and its coexisting diseases, analyzing the correlation between the autoimmune antibodies such as anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and the coexisting tumors, discussing the individual treatment plan and the prognosis outcome situation. Method(s): Fifteen SPS cases admitted in 1st affiliated hospital of Zhongshan university during the period from 2007-2017 were retrospectively analysed on the clinical and electro-physiological characteristics, therapies, prognosis outcome situations. Result(s): Three SPS patients had rigidity and spasms of lower extremities, five patients were of trunk and lower extremities, six patients were of limbs, two had dysphagia or dysarthria, four had diplopia, two of them had horizontal nystagmus. Four of the eight patients underwent anti-GAD antibody examination were seropositive. Two of the four patients who had abnormalities with the thyroid gland test were diagnosed of hyperthyroidism before, and one had type 1 diabetes mel-litus with anti-islet cell antibody positive. All the patients treated with benzodiazepines (diazepam and clonazepam), three of them treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, five with glucocorticoid. Seven patients had the Rankin scores improvement after treatment, one kept the same score. Conclusion(s): SPS is often misdiagnosed, and Anti-GAD antibody is an excellent marker for SPS that it can well reduce the rate of missed diagnosis, but monitoring their titers during the course of the disease may not be of practical value, thus, there is no need to increase the economic burden of patients. SPS with the symptom of eye movement disorder can be accompanied with thymoma and/or myasthenia gravis, so it is very necessary to do the contrast-enhanced CT scan to exclude thymoma in time, and the operation of thymoma can improve the prognosis of SPS and MG. Plenty of nonmotor symptoms such as phobia were found on SPS patients, and they need to be treated by cognitive behavioural therapy which can help recovering their social functions better.

PD  - /
AB  - Case Description: This patient initially presented with functional deterioration secondary to SPS with intractable muscle spasms in the bilateral lower extremities, low back, and right upper extremity, which was recalcitrant to oral anti-spasmodics. As such, an intrathecal baclofen (ITB) pump was placed with the catheter tip at the T10 level and over a 5-year period, the patient had reduced spasms and return to function with ITB dose titration. However, in the subsequent 6months following the improved function, the patient noted rapid progression of low back pain and gait instability. Before and after implantation x-ray imaging demonstrated a progression of thoracic dextroscoliosis with a Cobb angle of 40 degrees (from 10 degrees, 5 years prior) and lumbar levoscoliosis with Cobb angle of 50 degrees (from 8 degrees, 5 years prior). X-ray also revealed left lateral subluxation of L4 on L5 and L3 on L4 as well as grade 1 retrolisthesis of L3-4 and grade 1 anterolisthesis of L4-5. DEXA scan showed low bone density. Neurosurgical evaluation resulted in recommendation for spinal reconstruction. Setting(s): Outpatient center. Patient(s): A 59-year-old woman with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), stiff person syndrome (SPS), and thoracolumbar S-shaped scoliotic curvature. Assessment/Results: Although the patient's spasms and spasticity were well-controlled on ITB, she experienced accelerated progression of her thoracolumbar S-shaped scoliotic curvature into severe thoracolumbar scoliosis, requiring surgical intervention. Discussion(s): Although accelerated progression of scoliosis after ITB placement has been described in children with cerebral palsy, this is the first reported case, to our knowledge, of this phenomenon in a patient with SPS. Conclusion(s): Accelerated progression of scoliosis should be a consideration when treating spasticity with ITB in the adult population.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In patients with GAD-antibody (ab) associated neurological disorders coexistence of other autoimmune disorders is observed. METHOD(S): In this exploratory study we analysed variations in 33 candidate genes involved in autoimmunity or representing immunological check-points using next-generation sequencing. We performed haplotype-analysis of HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1. Additionally, we analysed levels of sFasL, IL10, and IL18 in serum of patients and healthy controls. RESULT(S): 19 patients (3 males, 16 females; mean age at onset: 46.4 years) with positive GAD-ab and the following neurological phenotypes were included: n = 8 cerebellar ataxia, n = 6 limbic encephalitis, n = 4 stiff person syndrome, n = 1 demyelinating CNS disease with recurrent optic neuritis. 15 patients exhibited at least one other autoimmune disorder and/or showed other auto-ab. We identified several variations in genes linked to autoimmunity or representing check-point proteins. Most frequently (14/19 patients, allele frequency: 42.1%), we observed an amino acid exchange in the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) gene. Two of the observed variants are known to cause alterations of protein function (Y446C in caspase-10, K750N in protein-tyrosin-phosphatase, non-receptor type 22). These latter variants were detected in two related patients (mother and daughter) who both present with GAD-ab-associated neurological disorders but with different clinical phenotypes. The rare haplotype DRB1*15:01:01 ~ DQA1*01:02:01 ~ DQB1*05:02:01 previously described in patients with GAD-ab-associated neurological disorders was not observed in any of our patients. No elevated serum levels of sFasL, IL18 or IL10 were observed in patients indicating no typical phenotype of autoimmune lymphoproliferate syndrome. CONCLUSION(S): These findings suggest genetic risk factors in patients with GAD-ab-associated neurological disorders.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) is the rate-limiting enzyme to convert glutamate to gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA). Autoantibodies targeted against GAD65 have been implicated in a number of syndromes with neurologic manifestations including stiff-person syndrome, cerebellar ataxia, limbic encephalitis, and epilepsy. We highlight an atypical presentation of this rare disorder with several unique features to the neurological intensive care unit. Methods Case report Results 62-year-old woman with PMH of DM, remote left insular ischemic stroke, and recent right leg dystonia presented after being found down with rightward eye gaze deviation, GTC shaking, and urinary incontinence. She required midazolam, lorazepam, loading doses of levetiracetam and fosphenytoin, and propofol infusion to achieve clinical seizure control. Despite these interventions, EEG showed NCSE with left temporal seizures and anterior midline epileptiform discharges. Propofol was titrated to burst suppression. She had several other active medical problems including kidney injury, transaminitis, and myoclonus. Seizures and myoclonus were greatly improved after the addition of clonazepam; however, she remained encephalopathic. Pertinent diagnostic results included ferritin 16,130 ng/ml, LDH 2,070 units/L, IL-2R 795 U/ml, B2-microglobulin 3.9 mg/L, normal NK function, CSF GAD65 titer 0.63 nmol/L, and serum GAD65 Ab titer 332 nmol/L. MRI Brain showed prominent superior frontal lobe cortical edema. Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated good cellularity without malignancy. Skin biopsies on three random samples were positive for perivascular dermatitis with telangiectasia. She was started on high dose steroids with subsequent progressive mental status improvement. Conclusions Anti-GAD65 Ab associated vasculitis is an exceedingly rare occurrence whose diagnosis previously involved brain biopsy. This case is unique given her acute presentation with refractory status epilepticus, systemic involvement, and diagnosis on skin biopsy. While management has involved immunotherapy, specific treatment guidelines do not exist. Given her marked response to clonazepam and corticosteroids, we advocate for early initiation of GABAergic medications such as benzodiazepines and use of immunotherapy.

AB  - Stiff limb syndrome (SLS) is a rare autoimmune-related central nervous system disorder, resulting in stiffness and spasms of limbs since onset with rare involvement of the truncal muscles. However, SLS patients will gain notable effects by appropriate therapy focusing on symptomatic treatment and immunotherapy. We reported on a 55-year-old female who showed typical painful spasms in both lower limbs and abduction of the right eyeball that partially responded to low-dose diazepam and had high-titer anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD) antibody. Electromyography (EMG) only showed continuous motor unit activity (CMUA) in the anterior tibialis and right triceps. Eventually, our patient was diagnosed with SLS and treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and glucocorticoid combined simultaneously. She obtained notable effects. We also review and summarize the current literature on clinical characteristics, coexisting disease, treatment, and outcome of 40 patients with SLS. We hope that this report will provide a basis for further understanding of SLS and promote the formation of more advanced diagnosis and treatment processes.© Copyright © 2020 Huang, Meng, Duan, Li, Xu, Zhou and Zhou.

AB  - Description: A 64-year-old man diagnosed with SPS presented to our university rehabilitation clinic with complaints of increased spasticity. He described feeling muscle tightness predominantly in his groin, calves and chest. His symptoms were marked by painful cramps that "caught him," and they were often strong enough that the cramps interfered with his voluntary control of his muscles: leading to falls. He presented having failed trials of oral baclofen (20 mg TID) and diazepam (10 mg PRN QID). These oral medications improved his stiffness, but interfered with his ability to perform at work. To solve these issues an intrathecal baclofen pump was implanted. Setting(s): University Hospital Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinic Results: At over 1-year post implantation, the patient continues to benefit from controlled spasms while minimizing the neurocognitive deficits he suffered while on the oral antispasmodic medications. The intrathecal baclofen has enabled our patient to remain a high functioning member of society: improving his quality of life. Discussion(s): SPS is a rare, difficult to treat, debilitating disorder with estimated prevalence of 1/1,000,000. It commonly presents with fluctuating muscle rigidity that may progress to severely interrupting a person's daily routine. SPS is believed to have an autoimmune origin as GAD antibodies are demonstrated in more than 70% of cases. Baclofen and benzodiazepines are first line treatment. However, these drugs are well known to cause central nervous system depression making their persistent use a challenge. Understanding the diagnosis and management of SPS is vital to improve care. Conclusion(s): It is important to consider implanting the intrathecal baclofen pump as we can provide SPS patients with comfort while preserving mental status.

AB  - Description: A 33-year-old woman, diagnosed with cerebellar ataxia at 23 years old, subsequently diagnosed with Stiff-man Syndrome at 30 years old. On examination, patient was dysarthric with otherwise intact cranial nerves. Motor strength was normal with brisk reflexes throughout. Hoffman and Babinski signs were negative bilaterally. She had finger-to-nose dysmetria, and positive Romberg. Gait showed imbalance and lateral sway during tandem walking. Patient resides with boyfriend who assists with housekeeping. She is independent with dressing, eating, and transfers. Setting(s): University Hospital Results: Her deficits from a rehabilitation perspective include dysar-thria, stiff lower extremities, and ataxic gait. Her ambulation and functionality have improved with physical therapy and monthly IVIG infusions. She sees speech therapy for dysarthria and dysphonia, and was referred to seating clinic for a suitable motorized ambulatory device. Discussion(s): Stiff-man syndrome is a rare central nervous system disorder characterized by progressive muscle stiffness and spasms. Rarely, patients later develop cerebellar ataxia. Literature shows that auto-antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are implicated in both conditions and typically present in high serum titers prior to clinical symptoms. Interestingly, our patient not only developed ataxia prior to stiffness, but initially had low anti-GAD titers despite already having symptoms, thus raising suspicion for a genetic component to her ataxia. However, this was ruled out and titers subsequently increased. Conclusion(s): This presentation highlights a rare combination of Grave's Disease, Stiff-man Syndrome, and cerebellar ataxia presenting prior to anti-GAD titers. Our patient is followed by physiatry, neurology, and is undergoing physical and speech therapy. She faces difficulty performing ADLs, maintaining an exhaustive appointment list, not to mention the burden placed on her significant other, which takes an emotional and social toll on a young patient. This case emphasizes how critical a multidisciplinary approach is for a unique combination of co-morbidities, making rehabilitation of this patient that much more difficult.

AB  - Stiff Person syndrome (SPS) is a rare, disabling syndrome characterized by progressive muscle stiffness and axial rigidity. It may have an autoimmune, paraneoplastic or cryptogenic etiology. A 59-year-old woman presented with stiffness and involuntary spasms in the lower extremities. In a neurologic examination, lower extremity and axial rigidity were revealed. Anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody was negative, anti-amphiphysin was antibody positive. She was diagnosed as having SPS. The symptoms were improved after intravenous immunoglobulin and cancer therapy.Copyright © 2020 by Turkish Neurological Society.

AB  - Background and aims: Thymoma is frequently associated with paraneoplastic diseases, myasthenia gravis being the most common. Rarely, progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) is encountered and it is usually associated with anti-glycine receptor antibodies (GlyR). Method(s): We report the case of a 32-year-old male diagnosed with PERM with multiple antibodies as a paraneoplastic manifestation of thymoma Results: The patient had a 6-day history of trismus, and progressive asymmetrical inferior limbs rigidity, associated with spontaneous and sleep induced hyperekplexia and piloerection, responsible for insomnia. Brain and spine MRI and electroencephalography were unremarkable. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed mild pleocytosis (7elem/mL). Electroneuromyography (ENMG) emphasized rare fibrillations without neuromyotonic phenomena. Anti GlyR, anti-GAD and anti CV2 antibodies came back positive. Thoracic CT with iodine findings were consistent with thymoma. Initially, the symptoms improved after thymectomy and under treatment with immunoglobulins and methylprednisolone. He suffered a relapse a month after surgery with bilateral eyelid ptosis. Myasthenia gravis was excluded. He improved under immunosuppressive treatment. At 6-month and 1-year follow-up the patient is stable, the antibodies titer decreased progressively, and he currently has no immunosuppressive treatment. Conclusion(s): A rapidly progressive stiff person syndrome in a young patient should be a red flag for PERM and it should not be tested only for GlyR antibodies. To conclude, PERM in the presence of multiple autoantibodies should always raise the suspicion pf thymoma.

AB  - Background and aims: Stiff person syndrome is a rare disease of the central nervous system, characterized by progressive stiffness and muscle spasms in the extremities and axial musculature. 60-80% have positive anti GAD antibodies and 10% have amphiphysin antibodies. Method(s): A 58-year-old woman from Equatorial Guinea started with weakness of lower limbs, stiffness and pain of the axial musculature that progresses over the time, with many accidental falls, leading to the need of using crutches for walking. On physical examination, she presented hyperlordosis with stiffness and hypertrophy of the dorsallumbar paravertebral muscles and painful muscle spasms of spinal and abdominal muscles, bilateral Hoffmann sign, bilateral incoordination of upper limbs and gait ataxia (more instability than expected due to slight rigidity of lower limbs). Result(s): Analysis disclosed positive anti-GAD, antithyroperoxidase and anti-gastric ATPase antibodies. The EMG showed continuous motor activity. Diagnosis of stiff person with cerebellar involvement was made. Immunoglobulin and plasmapheresis treatment was unsuccessful, some improvement was observed with 1g/day of methylprednisolone for 5 days. However, the symptoms persisted, associating dysphonia and dyspnea with a restrictive pattern in spirometry (due to thoracic stiffness). Finally, it was decided to start treatment with rituximab with a great improvement of symptoms. Conclusion(s): Stiff person syndrome with cerebellar component is rare. This patient had poor response to usual treatments, which requires finding therapeutic alternatives although its effectiveness has not been completely studied. We have to take in account that symptomatology guides the physician to take the decision and not the presence of positive antibodies. (Figure Presented).

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is highly associated with anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody. However, GAD antibodies alone appear to be insufficient to cause SPS, and they possibly are involved in only part of its pathophysiology. It is suspected that the symptoms of SPS get precipitated by external stimuli. Here, we briefly introduce the case of a patient with latent autoimmune diabetes who developed SPS through the action of subcutaneously injected insulin. A 43-year-old man was diagnosed with diabetes and initially well-controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents but progressed to requiring insulin within 1 year of diagnosis. Two months after the initiation of basal insulin therapy, he presented with abdominal stiffness and painful muscle spasms, involving the lower limbs, which resulted in walking difficulty, and thus, he refused insulin injections thereafter. He had been treated with oral anti-diabetic agents instead of insulin for 10 years until premixed insulin twice daily was started again due to poor diabetes control. Immediately after insulin injection, abdominal muscle rigidity and spasms were noted. When insulin was not administered, frequent episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis occurred. Serum GAD antibody test was positive and there was no positivity for islet antigen-2 antibody. A glucagon stimulation test demonstrated relative insulin deficiency, indicative of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). Tolerable muscle rigidity was achieved when the dosage of basal insulin was split into two separate daily injections with lower amounts of units per injection. This case highlights a different form of autoimmune diabetes in SPS. To our knowledge, this is the first report of SPS described shortly after the initiation of insulin therapy that required basal insulin to achieve tolerable muscle symptoms and better glucose control, without the development of diabetic ketoacidosis.© Copyright © 2020 Lee, Lin and Chen.

AB  - The association between stiff person syndrome and paraneoplastic syndromes has been described, linking intracellular or extracellular antibodies. We describe the case of a 64-year-old woman with stiff person syndrome and positivity for acetylcholine receptor ganglionic neuronal antibodies, which can also be seen in muscular hyperexcitability conditions, as well as other paraneoplastic syndromes. The relevance of this report is the possible direct elevation of this antibody due to a direct immunological cause. Acetylcholine receptor ganglionic neuronal antibodies have been reported with autoimmune autonomic neuropathy and paraneoplastic syndromes linked to lung cancer and myastheniform syndromes, as well as in some muscular hyperexcitability states, but not in stiff person syndrome.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: To identify if baseline characteristics such as phenotype, body-region involvement and others can predict disease burden and functional-outcomes in patients with Stiff-Person Syndrome (SPS). Background(s): SPS is a neuroimmunological disease that presents with various manifestations and can cause significant disability. It is not well-known whether there are potential risks-factors for disease-burden and future disability in SPS; especially factors that are present early on that give insight into worse prognosis. To identify if baseline characteristics such as clinical phenotype and body-region involvement help determine disease-burden and predict future disability/functional-outcomes in patients with Stiff-Person Syndrome(SPS). Design/Methods: Retrospective medical record review from 1997 to 2019 at Johns Hopkins. Clinical phenotypes were assigned by review of history and examination; classic SPS, stiff-limb syndrome, SPSplus( classic SPS+cerebellar/brainstem findings), pure cerebellar(no musculoskeletal symptoms/signs), and progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus(PERM). Initial symptom presentation(stiffness;spasms;cerebellar;brainstem) and stiffness location(limb;trunk/torso;face) were also recorded. We calculated modified-Rankin Scale(mRS) scores for each clinical visit and a subset had timed 25-foot walk(T25FW) available. We calculated if SPS phenotype or initial symptoms predicted change in mRS or T25FW over time using mixed effects models. Result(s): We identified 186 patients(average age of onset:42y[SD:14.4];73% female;27% nonwhite) with SPS-spectrum disorders with moderate-disability(median mRS=3.0; IQR:2-3). Both initial brainstem/cerebellar symptoms(iBSCeSym) and SPS-plus/cerebellar phenotypes were associated with high-mRS at baseline(mean difference in mRS for iBSCeSym:0.51; 95%CI:0.13- 0.88;p=0.009; SPS-plus:0.42; 95%CI:0.01-0.82;p=0.05; cerebellar:0.62; 95%CI:0.03-1.25;p=0.04). iBSCeSym and SPS-plus phenotypes were associated with slower-walking speeds (n=134; iBSCeSym:63% slower; 20.5-221.1%;p=0.002; SPS-plus:64% slower;18.1-227.1%;p=0.004). In longitudinal-analyses, SPS-phenotypes and initial symptoms did not predict change in mRS or T25FW. Conclusion(s): We describe a unique observation in the largest cohort of patients with SPS;SPSplus/ cerebellar phenotypes have greater disability at presentation compared to their counterparts. These findings suggest that disease phenotype and/or body-region involved may act as a biomarker for early disease-burden and emphasize the need for earlier diagnosis and considerations of implementing immune-therapies earlier.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare and disabling neurological disease characterized by progressive stiffness of skeletal muscles, rigidity and episodic painful muscle spasms, resulting in severely impaired volitionalmovements and ambulation in some patients (pts). Electromyography (EMG) typically shows continuousmotor activity. 60%-80% of affected pts have autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxyloase (GAD), a key enzyme for maintaining inhibitory CNS pathways. SPS is considered an autoimmune disease; immunomodulating drugs have been used to control disease activity. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) has been used to successfully treat ptswith autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and scleroderma that are resistant to conventional treatment.We asked if pts with severe SPS that failed to respond to at least 3 standard treatments could benefit from AHSCT.We report on the outcome of 9 pts (4 female, 5 male) with severe SPS who have undergone AHSCT at our Centers between May 2014 and July 2016. The diagnosis of SPS was confirmed by independent Neurological evaluation that included physical examination, EMG and elevated anti GAD65 autoantibodies. EMG criteria included continuous motor unit activity in axial/limb muscles with co-contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles. The mean age was 42 (range, 25-50) years. The mean years since diagnosiswas (range, 1.0-14.7).Median distribution of stiffness index (DSI, a standardized measure of stiffness for SPS) was 5 (range, 3-6). All pts were disabled due to SPS, required assistance for ambulation, and were unable towork. Autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) were mobilized with Rituximab and G-CSF followed by apheresis and cryopreservation. The conditioning regimen was BEAM: carmustine (300 mg/m2), etoposide (800 mg/m2), cytarabine (800 mg/m2), melphalan (140 mg/m2) plus rabbit ATG (mg/kg). Unmanipulated, thawed autologous PBSC were infused on day 0. Prednisone mg/kg/day (day +7 to +21)was given to prevent engraftment syndrome. Standard HSCT institutional guidelineswere used for prophylaxis against viral, bacterial and fungal infections. All pts engrafted without complications; there were no severe or unexpected adverse events. The initial response to treatment varied among pts: 7 of 9 pts experienced some improvement of DSI and functional/neurological status at 1 month post-AHSCT. By 1 to 2 years post AHSCT, all 9 pts achieved very significant and sustained improvement in DSI and functional status. EMG findings improved or normalized in all pts, anti-GAD65 titers decreased, and the majority of pts were able to taper off all benzodiazepine and antispasm medications and some were able to return to fulltimework. These preliminary findings suggest that AHSCT is well-tolerated and may be highly effective therapy for select pts with treatment-refractory, severe SPS.

AB  - Case: 66 years, male, white, engineer, type 1 DM (T1D)-LADA (24 years ago) + AntiGAD neurological syndrome (Stiff-man-SPS) 9 years 4 months, all time Anti-GAD +> 60 U/mL, progressive psychomotor agitation, cognitive loss (recent-memory-language) (Fig. 1). Firstly he used orally: aminotriptyline 75 mg/d-bd, gabapentin 600 mg/d-bd, hydantal 200 mg/d-bd, diazepan 40 mg/d/4x, flurazepan 30 mg and muscle-relaxant baclofen 30 mg/day/3x. IV Infusion/month: cyclophosphamide 14.29 mg/kg (3 cycles), IV-immunoglobulin 2 g/kg-w/m2(30 cycles). Later, he used smaller doses by interval/dose adjustments: Nowadays(cycle60) use IV-immunoglobulin 0.68 g/kg/3 m hospitalized. Oral drug was decreased with clinical improvement, Diazepan and Baclofen has equal dosis. Glycated hemoglobin (HBG) was < 6.5% up to 7 years evolution, despite dexamethasone use (Fig. 2). After presenting progressive psychomotor-agitation and cognitive-impairment antidepressants and antipsychotics were prescribed. After HBG = 12 he used 24 h nursing for T1D control. (Table Presented) Discussion: Stiff-person (SPS) is a rare neurological disease (1:1,000,000-1:2,000,000 ihb/year) fistly described in 1956. Pubmed-search as cognitive deficit + SPS = 10 articles, 5 case-reports, one patient had all the AntiGAD-stiff-person spectrum disorders described (SPSD). Epitopes recognized by SPSD-anti-GAD65 differ from T1D. It's been described T-lymphocyte-infiltration in the medulla. In T1D-LADA freq 1:10,000. In Central Nervous System (CNS), anti-GAD65 blocks inhibitory GABAergic-neurons. This deficit has been related to tetanus-toxin-sign, schizophrenia, and tetany of SPS, the agitation-cognitive alteration of SPSD, confused as psychiatric. One article revises the treatment of SPS-SPSD, maintaining the IV-immunoglobulins (Dalakas MC validated A-1-double blind), stimulating-GABA-neurons: Benzodiazepines and Baclofen as an improved treatment. Two review the physiology of SPSD: in rats with infusion of antibodies from patients, and a case-control-study suggests cognitive loss in anti-GAD65/non-carriers, needing increased sample. Recently Dalakas MC'Trial doesn't demonstrate statistical difference rituximab/placebo. We have already published another patient case study with lethal outcome without treatment and described this patient when the treatment was successful. Unfortunately, the patient had a cognitive loss without circulatory or immuno-neurological disease only SPSD. Final Comments: Our review confirm the best treatment for SPSD, despite this unexpected 9-year-evolution. Informed consent to publish had been obtained from the patient.

AB  - Case report: A 49-year-old woman presented unable to walk after a 6-month history of progressive right leg stiffness, foot spasms and pain. Physical examination confirmed markedly increased tone muscles and revealed her right foot was plantarflexed and inverted with no active or passive movement in the right ankle or knee due to increased tone. Cerebral and spinal MRI were unremarkable and cerebrospinal fluid examination was negative for pathologies. Electroneurography and myography revealed no neurological abormality. Suspected Stiff-Person Syndrome (SPS) was confirmed by the increased anti-GAD antibodies (722 UI/mL) and the marked improvement in rigidity and stiffness with clonazepam, baclofen and immunosuppressive treatment with azathioprine. Diabetes was diagnosed a year after (fasting glucose of 301 mg/dL, HbA1C of 9.9%, C-peptide of 0.2 ng/mL), requiring insulin since diagnosis. Patient remained in good general condition, with no new organ involvement. Some years after, her daughter, 27-years-old, presented the same clinic of SPS with slowly progressive stiffness, rigidity and painful muscle spasms. Diagnosis of SPS was confirmed. Diabetes with positive anti-GAD antibodies was diagnosed after 2 years and treated with insulin since diagnosis. Patient developed miastenia gravis after 3 years. She also presented a good response to treatment. Discussion(s): Stiff-Person Syndrome (SPS) is a rare neuroimmunologic disorder characterized by progressive muscle stiffness, rigidity and painful spasms. Clinical manifestations of SPS have been attributed to dysfunction of inhibitory mechanisms within the central nervous system. GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter, is produced by GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase) and is decreased in the presence of anti-GAD antibodies, which are markers of SPS (prevalence of 60-80%). There is a strong association with others autoimmune-mediated disorders, as type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), which is observed in 30% of SPS patients and also presents anti-GAD antibodies positivity (80%). An immune pathogenesis is accepted as the cause of SPS, but remains unclear whether anti-GAD antibodies are directly pathogenic, unlike in T1DM. Conclusion(s): SPS is a very rare disease without well established pathogenesis and debilitating nature if not recognized in time. Association with T1DM, anti-GAD antibodies and other autoimmune disorders could contribute to clinical suspicion and earlier diagnosis.

AB  - Purpose Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare chronic disorder characterized by painful recurrent involuntary muscle rigidity and spasms, with an estimated prevalence of 1-2 cases per million. Given an underlying autoimmune component is associated with these symptoms, SPS carries a Category III Grade 2C indication for therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). Additional data is required to establish the role of apheresis in SPS treatment and literature is sparse due to the rarity of this diagnosis. Given anecdotal belief in the seasonal variation of SPS and other autoimmune disease presentations, exacerbation data was analyzed for seasonal associations. Methods Herein we report a review of hospital-admitted SPS exacerbations from January 1, 2011 through October 31, 2017. We then review, in detail, the patients who were referred for TPE treatment following failed conventional therapy. A chi-square goodness-of-fit test to test the null hypothesis that there are equal proportions across the seasons was utilized for seasonal association analysis. Results 6 SPS patients (4 female, 2 male, aged 30-68 years) over 33 admissions were treated by our health system over the studied time period (seven (21.2%) in winter, six (18.2%) in the spring, eight (24.2%) in the summer, and twelve (36.4%) in the fall). The Chi-square for the timing of exacerbations equals 2.51, with 3 degrees of freedom, p=0.47, indicating no statistically significant seasonal effect. Three of the six patients had autoantibodies to 65 kDa glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the most commonly associated autoantibody. 3 patients were ultimately referred for TPE. Only one of these was GAD positive. Treatment regimen consisted of two to five 1-1.25 plasma volume TPE with albumin occurring every 1-3 days. All TPE treated patients showed improvements with TPE within 1 month and have returned for additional TPE with subsequent exacerbations. Conclusion No seasonal periodicity of SPS was identified in this data set. Given the success our apheresis service and referring providers have identified in these select patients, we continue to treat SPS exacerbations in conventional therapy-refractory individuals without reservation, regardless of autoantibody identification. We hope by contributing this information to the medical literature we can aid others in their treatment of this rare disease.

AB  - Purpose To provide a personalized approach for symptomatic patients with therapeutic plasma exchange-induced hypogammaglobulinema and documented (mild, moderate, severe) allergic reactions to fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Methods We present a challenging case of 68 year old woman with a GAD65 antibody-positive stiff person syndrome (ASFA Category III Grade 2C), refractory to Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusions with intractable muscle spasms in her chest and back. Due to extensive allergy history, including urticarial rash, wheezing and mucosal edema due to fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and Red Blood Cells (RBC) transfusions, albumin was initially used as the replacement fluid for weekly single volume therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) procedures. Approximately 4 months after weekly TPE initiation, (17 performed procedures with subjective improvement in symptoms) the patient experienced a chronic treatment resistant urinary tract infection and frequent upper respiratory viral infections. At that time the patient was not on any immunosuppressive therapy. Laboratory investigation revealed likely procedure-induced hypogammaglobinemia: IgG levels decreased to 147 mg/dl from 1007 mg/dl a month before the first procedure (reference range 700-1600 mg/dL). In TPE, maximal rate of IgG removal is achieved during the first 0.1-0.8 TPV with decreasing efficiency afterwards. FFP can be used as the replacement fluid and as a source immunoglobulins. Since this patient had a history of moderate allergic reactions, we wanted to limit her exposure to FFP (arbitrarily set at no more than 1000 mL), with optimal IgG removal. After careful consideration and extensive discussion with the patient, we opted to perform a 0.8 TPV instead of 1 TPV exchange and use FFP for the final liter of replacement fluid to provide a source of immunoglobulins. Plasma immunoglobulin and GAD65 Ab levels were reviewed before and after the intervention. Results The patient tolerated the subsequent 13 procedures with only 2 reported mild allergic reactions, both successfully treated with intravenous diphenhydramine administration. IgG levels gradually improved and currently remain steady at the 420-430 mg/dl range for the last 3 months (Figure 1). Her urinary tract infection resolved. The patient continues to report subjective improvement of her muscle stiffness. The anti-GAD65 titer has decreased to 0.37 from 0.68 nmol/L (reference range<=0.02 nmol/L) and has been stable for the last 6 months. Conclusion Chronic and frequent therapeutic plasma exchange is known to be immunosuppressive. The degree of hypogammaglobinemia is highly variable and depends on frequency and duration of the procedures, concomitant treatment regimen and overall status of the patient. Decreasing the volume exchanged could be considered for a symptomatic patient with hypogammaglobinemia and (Figure Presented) ongoing need for therapeutic plasma exchange (e.g. Guillain- Barre syndrome) when allergic reactions limit the volume of FFP one can use as replacement fluid.

TI  - Stiff person's syndrome: Challenging symptom control
AU  - Thakolkaran N.T.

AB  - Background: Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is characterized by progressive rigidity and muscle spasms affecting axial and limb muscles. Prevalence is 1-2 per million, most patients between 20-50 years, affects women 2-3 times more. The subtypes are Classic, Partial and paraneoplastic SPS. SPS is frequently associated with anti-Glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies. This case highlights the challenge with symptom management in a patient where intrathecal route was contraindicated. Method(s): Case report Results: 73 y/o Caucasian female with a h/o HTN, CAD, contractions of bilateral Achilles tendons, and SPS, who was admitted for elective tendon lengthening of the b/l Achilles. Two months before this procedure, patient was diagnosed with SPS by EMG (co-activation of the agonist and antagonist muscles in the L distal leg) and CSF studies which were positive for antiamphiphysin antibodies. Treatment included steroid taper and Immunoglobulin for 5 days. Paraneoplastic workup was negative. She was on Oxycodone(5mg q6h prn), acetaminophen( 650mg q6h prn), baclofen(20mg q8h) and diazepam (3mg q8h prn) for pain and spasm control. Patient started having worsening crying episodes post-surgery; 5-7 episodes/hour. It was attributed to pain and spasm. Increase in dosage was challenging as over medication caused somnolence while under dosing caused continuous spasms. She received intrathecal catheter placement (hydromorphone and baclofen). Next day, she had an acute L posterior temporal stroke and the catheter was discontinued. Her condition was complicated with inability to communicate due to aphasia. Oxycodone was changed to 5mg q6h due to concerns that patient was unable to ask for meds. There was no change in symptoms. The psychology team assisted with mood changes induced by the spasms. We increased diazepam to 5mg q8h, duloxetine to 60mg daily and her episodes were slightly less frequent. Third day, diazepam was increased to 10 mg q8h with no excessive somnolence. Frequency of episodes was lowered to few/ day. Keeping a log of spasm episodes helped to titrate medications. The discharge regimen was diazepam 10mg Q8H, gabapentin 600mg Q8H, baclofen 20mg Q8H, oxycodone 5mg Q6H, duloxetine 60mg daily, and trazodone 12.5mg qhs. Conclusion(s): This case illustrates that symptom management in SPS can be challenging to create a balance between symptom control and avoiding side effects. Psychological aspects of the care should also be taken into consideration.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether in SPS, CSF anti-GAD antibodies correlate with clinical severity and disease progression. Background(s): SPS is a naturally progressive disorder, characterized by muscle rigidity and episodic spasms in axial and limb musculature, along with heightened sensitivity to external stimuli. SPS is associated with high titer anti-GAD antibodies in both serum and CSF. Design/Methods: CSF was examined for anti-GAD antibodies and intrathecal GAD-specific IgG synthesis in 32 typical SPS patients and 5 patients with SPS and cerebellar disease (SPS-Cer). Anti-GAD antibodies were also measured in serial CSF samples (first and 2-year visits) in 10 patients not receiving immunotherapy. Result(s): In the 32 SPS patients, the GAD CSF-titers ranged from 30-2,000 Standard Units (mean, 280; normal 0). The mean titer ratio of anti-GAD CSF/serum was 0.01 and the mean ratio of CSF/serum IgG was 0.002 indicating a 4-fold increase of intrathecal GAD-IgG specific production. In the SPS-Cer patients, the mean ratio of CSF/serum anti-GAD titers was 0.03 and the mean CSF/serum IgG ratio 0.002, indicating a 10-fold increase of intrathecal anti-GAD antibody production and 2.5-fold higher compared to the typical SPS cohort. No overall correlation was noted between GADCSF titers or intrathecal synthesis with disease severity. In the 10 repeatedly tested patients who continued to worsen clinically, the mean CSF titer after 2 years remained persistently high (24,013 International Units/ml vs 19,855 IU/ml; two-tailed paired t-test, p=0.55]. Conclusion(s): In SPS there is intrathecal GAD-specific IgG synthesis indicating chronic B-cell activation within the CNS. The higher intrathecal GAD-specific IgG production in SPS-Cer patients probably reflects the more extensive neurological phenotype. Although there was no overall correlation between CSF anti-GAD intrathecal production or GAD titers with clinical severity, the persistence of GAD intrathecal synthesis over 2-year period, without immunotherapy, was consistent with continuous disease progression.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate respiratory manifestations in Stiff-person Syndrome (SPS) patients. Background(s): Approximately 50% of SPS patients report dyspnea contributing to their functional impairment. This study investigates the frequency and severity of dyspnea and associated pulmonary function abnormalities in SPS. Design/Methods: SPS patients were recruited prospectively from neurology clinic in a single university center. Dyspnea was assessed for each subject via a vertical Visual Analogue Scale on the day of study visit and during the preceding two weeks, and by the University of San Diego Shortness Of Breath Questionnaire. Standardized assessments of SPS severity: Heightened Sensitivity Scale and the Distribution of Stiffness Scale were obtained by an experienced neurologist. Spirometry was performed on all patients on the same day as assessment of dyspnea. Result(s): Mean patients' age was 56.1 +/-13.1 SD years. 15/16 were women. 14/15 complained of dyspnea: 10 both at rest and with exertion, 3 only with exertion, and 1 only at rest. Mean UCSDSOBQ score was 61.2 +/- 37.95. Group mean FVC % predicted was 76.5 +/-17.99; FEV1 % predicted 81.6 +/-19.72; FEV1/FVC 85.2 +/-10.02. 5/15 patients showed a restrictive pattern on spirometry, 9 had normal spirometry, and 1 patient with concomitant bronchiectasis showed a combined restrictive/obstructive pattern. There was a significant inverse correlation between VAS2 weeks and FVC %predicted (r = -0.61, p=0.017) and FEV1 %predicted (r = -0.65, p=0.008). There was no significant association between pulmonary function and the following: VAS1 day, UCSD-SOBQ, Distribution of Stiffness, or Heightened Sensitivity. No correlation between dyspnea scores and the measures of SPS disease severity was found. Conclusion(s): Many SPS patients show a restrictive spirometry pattern, and there is some association between simple measures of dyspnea and pulmonary function. Chest wall constriction and/or superimposed truncal muscles spasms may be the underlying mechanism to sensation of dyspnea and objective respiratory compromise. Potential involvement of diaphragmatic muscles is unknown.

AB  - Objective: NA Background: Glycine receptor (GlyR) antibodies are detected in the disorder referred to as progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) or stiff person syndrome plus. We present a case of GlyR antibody associated PERM where patient additionally tested positive for CSF anti-NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antibody. Relapsing course of disease was seen. Design/Methods: NA Results: A previously healthy 70-yearold female on long-term levothyroxine therapy for hypothyroidism presented with two weeks of jerking in legs with stiffness, facial spasm, dysphagia, and dysarthria. Electroencephalographic findings of disorganized background indicating encephalopathy without epileptiform activity were seen. CSF testing showed lymphocytic pleocytosis with increased protein and NMDAR antibodies. GlyR antibodies were present in serum and CSF. CSF investigations (anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, amphiphysin antibodies, oligoclonal bands, viral PCR, bacterial panel), MRI brain, and serum investigations (HIV, hepatitis C, TSH, copper, methylmalonic acid, heavy metals, serum and urine protein electrophoresis) were unremarkable. Serum anti-thyroglobulin antibody was elevated. Extensive malignancy workup was unremarkable. Patient responded partially to plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin and intravenous methylprednisolone and lower extremity jerks disappeared. Diazepam and baclofen helped with muscle stiffness. She was discharged on prednisone which was discontinued due to infection and patient relapsed with leg stiffness, limb ataxia, worsening dysarthria, auditory hallucinations, disorientation and agitation. On readmission, she improved with intravenous immunoglobulin and intravenous methylprednisolone. Rituximab was administered and further improvement was seen such that at discharge she was oriented to time, place and person, hallucinations had resolved and there was significant improvement in axial and limb rigidity. Conclusion(s): The rapidly progressive course of autoimmune encephalitides in rare cases of multiple antibody positivity has been described previously. This case highlights favorable response to aggressive immunotherapy in a patient with predominantly PERM phenotype with positive GlyR and NMDA antibodies, in addition to a possible association of disease with other autoimmune entities such as autoimmune thyroiditis..

AB  - Objective: Evaluate autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) as a treatment option for severe, treatment refractory Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) Background: SPS is a rare neurological disease characterized by progressive stiffness, rigidity and painful muscle spasms that may result in impaired quality of life and severe disability. Dysregulation of neuronal firing leads to continuous, unregulated motor activity. There is evidence for an underlying autoimmune process. Approximately 70% of patients have antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxyloase (GAD), an enzyme critical for maintaining inhibitory CNS pathways. Symptomatic and immunosuppressive agents are used for treatment, though some patients do not respond adequately. AHSCT has been used successfully in other autoimmune diseases resistant to conventional treatment, such as multiple sclerosis and scleroderma. Design/Methods Patients with independently confirmed severe SPS who failed at least 3 standard immunosuppressive treatments underwent AHSCT. Result(s): Between May 2014 and July 2016, 9 cases with severe SPS underwent AHSCT: 4 females, 5 males, mean age 42 (25-50), mean years since diagnosis 5.3 years (1-14.7), all disabled and unable to work, most required assistance for ambulation. Baseline median distribution of stiffness index (DSI), a standardized measure of stiffness ranging from 0-6, was 5 (3-6). No engraftment complications, severe or unexpected adverse events occurred. The initial treatment response varied; 7 of 9 patients experienced some improvement of DSI and functional status at 1 month post-AHSCT. However, by 1 to 2 years post-AHSCT all 9 patients achieved very significant and sustained reductions in DSI and neurological disability. EMG findings improved or normalized in all patients, anti-GAD65 titers decreased, and the majority of patients were able to taper off all benzodiazepine and antispasm medications and some were able to return to full-time work. Conclusion(s): These preliminary findings suggest that AHSCT is well-tolerated and may be a highly effective therapy for selected patients with treatmentrefractory, severe SPS.

AB  - Objective: Not applicable Background: Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is caused by antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), causing excitability, decreasing neuronal inhibition. Alterations in GABA production cause stiffness and muscle spasms. Classically, the primary deficit in SPS is axial muscle rigidity and paroxysmal muscle spasms, causing severely impaired gait. We report a case of SPS that presented with stroke like symptoms with acute onset spastic dysarthria. Design/Methods: A literature review was done for all reported cases of SPS via Pubmed. Search terms were "spastic dysarthria?, "glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody?, "stroke symptoms?, and "stiff person syndrome?. Only English language publications were included if the diagnosis of SPS presented with stroke like symptoms. Result(s): 56 year old right handed female with hypertension and vitiligo, presented with dysarthria and right upper motor neuron facial weakness. Stroke work up was negative. She had left leg spasticity, mild left hamstring and quadriceps weakness, and hyperreflexia in the lower extremities. Work up for motor neuron disease and myelopathy were unremarkable. Further history revealed multiple falls with left leg weakness and stiffness. Later, she developed right upper extremity stiffness. CSF was positive for 7 oligoclonal bands and GAD antibody was highly positive (1651 nmol/L, normal <0.02 nmol/L). The patient was started on IVIg treatment with improvement of spasticity, with intermittent spastic dysarthria. Conclusion(s): Stiff person syndrome can present with acute spastic dysarthria mimicking stroke. Work-up for acute stroke is appropriate however, careful history may reveal more chronic symptoms, leading to a very different diagnosis and treatment. It is of benefit to recognize that one autoimmune disorder often leads to another. In one retrospective study, patients with high titers of GAD antibodies did not present with classic SPS symptoms, and were at greater risk for having a paraneoplastic syndrome, despite paraneoplastic SPS often being antibody negative. Our malignancy work up was negative.

AB  - Objective: To present a case demonstrating progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) following West Nile Virus (WNV) encephalitis. Background(s): PERM is a rare, likely autoimmune process within the central nervous system, which is included on the stiff person syndrome spectrum. PERM is associated with several autoantibodies. The most common autoantibody within the disease spectrum is against glutamic acid decarboxylase isoform 65 (GAD- 65). The clinical features of PERM include transient axial, truncal or limb spasms, encephalopathy, oculomotor dysfunction, autonomic dysfunction and upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction. A similar case of GAD-65 autoimmunity has been reported following WNV infection. Design/Methods: NA Results: We report a case of a 55 year old Caucasian woman with a recent history of West Nile Virus encephalitis who presented with three days of progressive body spasms, confusion and fevers. She had autonomic instability with labile blood pressure and intermittent diaphoresis. She was intubated for airway protection. On examination, she demonstrated a left gaze preference, axial and limb rigidity, diffuse hyperreflexia including a positive jaw jerk, Hoffman sign and a right Babinski. She had frequent neck, arm and leg spasms especially with stimulation. MRI of her brain and spine were normal. CSF studies found elevated protein (122 mg/dL) with pleocytosis (74 nucleated cells/mcl). Serum and CSF anti-GAD-65 antibodies were positive at 74.1 nmol/L and 3.92 nmol/L, respectively (ref. range <0.02). She was treated with high dose intravenous methylprednisolone followed by plasmapheresis. Her mentation and spasms improved. Conclusion(s): This case presents an example of anti-GAD-65 associated PERM following a WNV encephalitis. Future studies are needed to evaluate a potential parainfections association between WNV infection and GAD-65 autoimmunity.

AB  - Objective: To describe the expanding clinical phenotypes of variant-stiff person syndrome (v-SPS) Background: SPS is a rare disorder characterized by rigidity and stiffness of the axial and lower extremity muscles with superimposed spasms. v-SPS includes a limited form, Stiff-limb syndrome, and other conditions such as cerebellar ataxia, brainstem syndromes, and progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus. Design/Methods: Systematic review of medical records from 1999 to 2017 at Johns Hopkins Hospital revealed 103 patients with diagnosis of SPS, of which 18 (17.4%) fit the category of v-SPS. v- SPS criteria included patients with atypical features of SPS. Result(s): Of our v-SPS cohort, the average age of symptom onset was 54- years (range, 28-75 years), average age at diagnosis was 57-years (range, 30-76 years), and 72% were female. Phenotypes included 2/18 stiff limb syndrome, 14/18 pure cerebellar, and 2/18 comprised overlap of cerebellar and bulbar syndromes. Coexisting autoimmune conditions were present in approximately 50% of patients; thyroiditis, rheumatic conditions, pernicious anemia, and diabetes. Two were associated with malignancies (breast and small cell lung cancer). All patients had anti-GAD65 antibodies detected in the serum. Of those with endpoint titers (16/18), the average was 44,556 nmol/L (range, 4-256,000 nmol/L). 6 of 8 patients with CSF tested had anti-GAD65 antibodies detected. Neuroimaging was abnormal in four patients: 3 had cerebellar atrophy; 1 had midbrain lesions. Fourteen received immunotherapy (IVIG, PLEX, and/or rituximab), 12 reported some degree of clinical improvement. Conclusion(s): This case series aims to increase awareness of the rare but increasingly recognized v-SPS. Our results corroborate prior series demonstrating that v-SPS presents in mid-life, is more likely autoimmune, and often coexists with other autoimmune conditions. The presence of very high anti-GAD65 antibodies in the majority of patients tested emphasizes the importance of this diagnostic test. Early consideration should be given to v-SPS, even in the setting of non-classical features of SPS.

AB  - Objective: To describe a patient with stiff person syndrome (SPS) whose symptoms and disability improved during pregnancy. Background(s): SPS is a rare neuroimmunological condition characterized by severe, debilitating spasms of axial and limb muscles. Antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65-Ab) are found in up to 80% of patients with classic SPS. SPS likely involves both humoral and cellular immunity. The effect of estrogens on immunomodulation has been described in several autoimmune conditions. However, little is known regarding associations of estrogen and pregnancy in SPS. Design/Methods: Case Results: A 23-year-old G1P0 woman presented for evaluation of severe, intermittent spasms and stiff gait triggered by startle, bright lights, and temperature extremes. Prior to pregnancy, she was hospitalized for encephalopathy and intractable spasms. Serum GAD65-Ab obtained during hospitalization was positive at 1017 U/mL. One year later, spasms were controlled with 90 mg diazepam and 80 mg baclofen daily. Subsequently, she became pregnant and was able to wean antispasmodics given improvement in spasms and ambulation. Repeat serum GAD65-Ab was >256,000 U/mL. Throughout pregnancy, the patient reduced antispasmodics to 20 mg baclofen and 10 mg diazepam daily. She reported continued improvement in her SPS symptoms. Conclusion(s): We present a case of anti- GAD65-associated SPS in a woman who symptomatically improved with pregnancy. Four reports of pregnancy in patients with SPS are found in the literature. Of four patients, two were able to wean antispasmodics after the first trimester. The remaining two included one patient who required resuming diazepam after discontinuation in the first trimester; another was diagnosed with limb-variant SPS in the third trimester. In normal pregnancy, rises in estradiol shift cytokine production by increasing anti-inflammatory Th2 and Th17 cells. A Th2 shift may contribute to improvement of autoimmune diseases mediated by cellular immunity. Further investigations are required to determine the role of cellular immunity in SPS and the response to pregnancy in this population.

AB  - Introduction: Glycine receptor antibody positive progressive encephalopathy with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) or 'stiff person syndrome' is a recently described, rare phenomenon. First documented in 2008 by Hutchinson et al2, it is characterised by rigidity, muscle spasms, hyperekplexia and brainstem signs (including oculomotor disturbances and fluctuating levels of consciousness3). It is potentially fatal and response to treatment is variable. Case: A previously healthy 58-year old male presented to a regional hospital complaining of hiccoughs&chest discomfort. CTPA and cardiac investigations were normal. He represented 48 h later with visual hallucinations, confusion, agitation, headaches & dysphagia. Neurological exam was otherwise normal but CSF analysis revealed an elevated white cell count at 50/muL (100% monocytes) and elevated protein of 484 mg/L. Empiric treatment for meningoencephalitis was commenced. He continued to deteriorate with reduced level of consciousness& respiratory compromise requiring intubation for airway protection and was subsequently transferred to MMUH. Generalised tonic-clonic seizures began soon after intubation requiring multiple antiepileptic medications and continuous propofol and midazolam infusions for control. CSF & blood were sent for autoantibody screens. Empiric treatment for autoimmune encephalitis was commenced, initially high dose methylprednisolone and IVIG, followed by plasmapheresis and initiation of rituximab. His clinical state was complicated by multiple vertebral fractures secondary to severe myoclonic jerks. Following PXC and rituximab there has been improvement in consciousness level and reduction in spasticity and hyperekplexia and isweaning frommechanical ventilation. Discussion(s): This is a case presentation of a rare autoimmune disorder, which was ultimately identified to be glycine receptor antibody positive PERM. Improvements in testing have led to increased detection and accurate diagnosis for autoimmune neurological syndromes, which provide the opportunity to treat potential reversible diseases. Some institutions routinely screen CSF samples for autoantibodies and have higher detection rates, an argument could be made for this to become normal practice globally.

TI  - Spasmodic reflex myoclonus-an characteristic electrophysiological manifestation for the diagnosis of Stiff-person syndrome
AU  - Tsai C.-H. 
PY  - 2018
PD  - /
AB  - Introduction: Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare disease entity and the pivotal clinical features contain progressive course of fluctuating stiffness of the low back and lower limbs. Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) is one of the unique variants of stiff person syndrome, and it was characterized with rigidity, stimulus-sensitive spasms, myoclonus, autonomic disturbance, and brainstem signs. These features resemble those of hyperekplexia. The accurate diagnosis of SPS is difficult but is crucial for the in time intervention with immunotherapy for life saving. In addition to the detection of responsible antibody, clinical electrophysiological manifestation, spasmodic reflex myoclonus, would be of great help in establishing the diagnosis. Method(s): Multichannel surface electromyogram (sEMG) and accelerometer recordings were conducted over the lumbar paraspinalis, rectus abdominalis, quadriceps, and hamstring muscles. Stimulus sensitive phenomenon was illustrated with accelerometer tapped over the pinprick. The signals were processed and digitized with CED power1401 with Spike2. The band pass for sEMG was set from 80 Hz to 1000 Hz. Result(s): The results demonstrated that episodes of spontaneous onset of spasm of the low trunk and legs lasted about seconds to minutes. Stimuli with nose tip tapping, would elicit vigorous jerks with dissemination of long lasting muscle spasm of the neck, paraspinal muscle, rectus abdominalis muscle, to quadriceps and hamstring muscles in a descending spreading pattern. The unique electrophysiological manifestations illustrate the characteristic feature of spasmodic reflex myoclonus. The surface EMG recording also showed the phenomena of habituation, in which a trend of amplitude decrescendo from the first toward the third EMG responses were observed during consecutive auditory stimulus. The serum levels of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 antibodies was 164 IU. Conclusion(s): The unique EMG pattern can help identify SPS. The clinical features of spasmodic reflex myoclonus are similar to hyperekplexia. However, there are some differences between the two phenomena. Unlike hyperekplexia, the spasmodic reflex myoclonus can be habituated after repetitive stimulation in the SPS patient. Furthermore, the initial myoclonic bursts of spasmodic reflex myoclonus were not present in hyperekplexia and the EMG burst duration was much shorter of the hyperekplexia as compared with that of spasmodic reflex myoclonus. These neurophysiological features discern spasmodic reflex myoclonus from hyperekplexia and are helpful in making diagnosis of SPS.

AB  - Objective: To describe a case of refractory Stiff Person Syndrome that had an excellent response to Rituximab therapy. Background(s): Stiff person syndrome is unusual autoimmune movement disorder. Anti-GAD antibody is very frequent and patients are responsive to immunosuppressive therapy in many cases, but with until 60% refractoriness. Method(s): Case report and literature review. Result(s): A 48-year-old man was admitted in the emergency department presenting myoclonias and paraspinal and abdominal dystonic postures, when tetanus was suspected. He was improved after support therapy. Patient was discharged and admitted after 15 days, due to symptoms worsening. Stiff-person syndrome was suspected and he received immunoglobulin, with a good response. Brain MRI was normal and CSF revealed mild pleocytosis and increased protein concentration. Serum and CSF anti-GAD antibody were positive. After 1 year, myoclonic movements restarted and became continuous. IVIG was prescribed but no clinical response was detected. Pulse therapy was also tried associating methylprednisolone and ciclofosfasmide but mioclonic spasms remained. At this time, patient was kept in the ICU using high doses of benzodiazepines and levetiracetam, but myoclonic movements were very frequent. Due to poor response, plasmapheresis was initiated, but kept a high frequency of myoclonical spasms when sedation was turned off. Rituximab was then initiated due to refractoriness of the patient to all available treatments. Then patient started to present clinical improvement, with progressive regain of motor skills and mioclonic movements control. After 7 months, patient was discharged, still needing help for daily living activities. In ambulatory follow up evaluations, he presented a progressive improvement, becaming independent in all daily (Figure presented) and instrumental activities with no cognitive impairment. Regular rituximab pulses were prescribed in 6 months, due to sporadic muscular dystonic and myoclonic activities, especially in abdominal and paravertebral muscles. Neoplasia screening remained negative. Conclusion(s): The prompt recognition of this syndrome is extremely relevant because it is a life-threatening disorder. Outset of appropriate therapy can drastically change the outcome of the case. The symptomatic and immunosuppressive treatment is variable and most of the trails present a small number of patients with a relatively short period of follow-up. Rituximab may be an option to be considered once patients show a poor response to the first imunossupressive treatment.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study is to discern whether there are reports that SPS has presented with stroke like symptoms. Background(s): Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is due to neuronal hyperexcitability from antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), decreasing GABA production in the central nervous system (CNS). This decrease in CNS inhibition leads to stiffness and muscle spasms. Classically, the primary deficit in SPS is axial muscle rigidity and paroxysmal muscle spasms (Table 1). We report a case of SPS that presented with acute onset spastic dysarthria. Method(s): A literature review was done via PubMed. Search terms were "spastic dysarthria", "glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody", and "stiff person syndrome", and there were no found reports of their association. Result(s): 56 year old right handed female with a past medical history of vitiligo presented with sudden onset dysarthria, right upper motor neuron facial weakness, one month of left leg stiffness, and imbalance. The patient was admitted and stroke work up was negative. Further work up for motor neuron disease and myelopathy were unremarkable. Lumbar puncture revealed 7 oligoclonal bands, and GAD antibody was positive at 1651 nmol/L (normal <0.02 nmol/L). The patient was started on IVIg treatment with improvement of her spasticity, but continued to have intermittent spastic dysarthria. Conclusion(s): In conclusion, SPS can present with acute dysarthria mimicking stroke, and has not been reported before. Thus, evaluation for acute stroke is appropriate in these cases, and careful history may reveal more chronic symptoms leading to a very different diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Objective: To describe the effects of intrathecal baclofen (ITB) on clinical, balance and gait parameters of two Stiff Person's patients. Background(s): Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare progressive disorder characterized by severe axial and/or limb rigidity, spasms, and continuous motor unit activity on electromyography. Clinical symptoms have great impact on balance and gait. Method(s): We enrolled two anti-GAD positive SPS patients: a 45-year-old woman and a 35-year-old man. They had refractory symptoms to gabaergic drugs and partial clinical response to chronic immunossupressive treatment. ITB pump implantation was preceded by a single-ITB injection test dose of 75 mcg. Clinical assessments of pain (visual analogue scale-VAS), spasticity (Ashworth scale) and timed up and go test were performed pre and post ITB injection test. An instrumented wireless gait analysis (MobilityLab?) was additionally performed preand post ITB injection test. Result(s): Ashworth scale improved on both patients; pain VAS also improved (mean: 53.3%); fatigue scale did not change on both patients; timed up and go test improved on both step number and walking time through 10 meters. Instrumented analysis (Table 1 and 2) revealed improvement on balance and gait measures as signaled by reduction on sway area (mean: 54.5%), sway velocity (mean: 56.9%), and jerkiness (mean: 60.8%). There was increase in gait cadence (mean: 39.4%), foot strike angle (mean: 124.5%), and turn velocity (mean: 56.4%). There was reduction on gait cycle duration (mean: 56.3%), double support time (mean: 67.8%), and on anticipatory postural adjustment time (mean:62.2%). Conclusion(s): intrathecal baclofen promoted a clinical significant improvement in spasticity, as well as in balance and gait parameters. ITB pump implantation should be considered as a symptomatic therapy for those patients with refractory SPS.

AB  - Objective: To describe an unusual presentation of stiff person syndrome (SPS) in a young patient admitted to our hospital in status dystonicus. Background(s): SPS is a rare autoimmune syndrome characterized by progressive, fluctuating isometric muscle contractions that are forceful and painful. Patients may also have muscle spasms provoked by movement, external stimuli, or emotional states. Method(s): Case report. Informed consent was obtained from the patient.A 20-year-old right-handed male presented to our emergency department with increasingly frequent and severe episodes of generalized muscle rigidity and dystonia. He had an 18-month history of back pain, severe painful muscle spasms, diaphoresis and falls associated with depression and anxiety. The episodes had no obvious triggers, alleviating or exacerbating factors. He developed progressive difficulty walking, which impaired activities of daily living and caused him to drop out of school 9 months after symptom onset.18 months after symptom onset, the patient was admitted in status dystonicus with several episodes of muscle spasms and dystonia lasting for up to 5 minutes. Result(s): Laboratory tests were remarkable for severe acidosis (pH 7.0) and rhabdomyolysis (CK>20,000). EEG and MRI brain with and without contrast were unremarkable. CSF analysis showed normal glucose (176), protein (32), nucleated cell count (1) and cultures including encephalitis panel were negative. Antibody testing revealed elevated anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65 titer (116) and a diagnosis of SPS was made. The episodes were refractory to pharmacological therapy including baclofen, carbamazepine, trihexyphenidyl and lorazepam. The patient required use of paralyzing agents and intubation. He was treated with IVIG for 5 days and discharged on clonazepam and baclofen with marked improvement in his condition. Conclusion(s): Our case provides an unusual description of SPS presenting as status dystonicus in a patient with severe muscle rigidity and spasms. We provide a photograph and can provide a video demonstration of the involuntary movements, which we hope will aid other practitioners in the early recognition and treatment of this condition. We also demonstrate that IVIg may improve the clinical course of this syndrome.

AB  - Introduction The stiff person syndrome it's a rare and not common neurological disorder, of unknown aetiology. There have been more than over 250 cases in the last 30 years. It consists in a long-term evolution of progressive muscle rigidity, with painful muscle spasms, mainly axial and pelvic limbs that lead progressively to disability, associated comorbidity and death due to complications. Symptoms generally start between the 4th and the 5th decade of life. Methods 39 years old worker, purified water seller, 2 years in service, with 20 Kg weight lifting. He begins with lumbar pain that doesn't respond to regular treatment; continues with decreased movement due to muscle rigidity, beginning with the upper extremities, moving forward to the pelvic limbs, with myoclonus and chorea, relating the symptoms to physical activity or stress that persists at rest. Physical examination: a slow and assisted walked was observed. Hypertonic lower limbs; presented myoclonus. Abolished reflections, strength and sensibility preserved. Myoclonus presented during examination with stiffness lower limbs, following walk tests. He continued without responding to treatment. Diazepam medication is added so he could fall asleep. He remains bedridden, performing only needed movements, with pain aggravation while presenting spasms. Results Electromyography compatible with cervical and lumbar radiculopathy. Magnetic resonance without alterations. No Anti GAD test taken, considering only normal clinical description, laboratory data and consultancy results for diagnosis of the patient was stablished as stiff person syndrome with myoclonus version, determining incapacity due to a low compatibility with his job. Discussion Progressively severe muscle stiffness typically develops in the spine and lower extremities; often beginning during a period of emotional stress. To make a right stiff man diagnose normality data in imaging studies are needed, laboratory data not concluding from another pathology, and relating clinical description. Anti GAD is presented only in 60% of the patients.

AB  - Objective: To describe a rare presentation of a young-onset Stiff Person Syndrome patient. Background(s): The Stiff-Person syndrome (SPS) is classically characterized by progressive stiffness with muscle spasms, involving the axial and limb muscles, and exaggerated startle responses (Hyperekplexia). The phenotypic spectrum is broad and can be expressed as classical SPS, Stiff limb syndrome, and other variants that combine additional neurological symptoms (Stiff person plus), or even as Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM). The diagnosis of this disease in clinical practice is difficult, and may sometimes mimic other disorders. Method(s): Case-report. Result(s): A 27-year-old young woman develops intermittent paroxysmal distal muscle contractions of the left lower limb (LLL), initially during exercise, but latter present also at rest. About 6 months' latter the lower limb dystonic postures started to be more frequent and characterized by left foot inversion, with progressive gait limitation. At this time, the patient starts to experience anxiety and depressive symptomatology and begins escitalopram 20 mg. About 1 month later, she suffered a subacute rapid worsening of the dystonic postures, becoming fixed, more painful and with complete loss of gait. After initiation of benzodiazepines and trihexyphenidyl in progressive titration and SSRI suspension, there was a progressive improvement of the dystonic symptomatology. From the remaining personal history, it was relevant for the presence of type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, insulin-treated. A therapeutic trial with levodopa/carbidopa (until 400 mg/day) was performed without benefit. Brain MRI did not reveal any structural abnormalities. Brain PET-BetaCIT was unremarkable. Genetic NGS panel for dystonia (58 genes) was negative. About 2 months later the patient develops hyperreactivity to auditory and tactile stimuli and myoclonus of the right hand. The Serum antiglutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) was positive and subsequently confirmed its presence in CSF. EMG was also compatible with SPS. Conclusion(s): This case report describes a rare presentation of SPS, at the beginning resembling a dystonic syndrome with focal onset of the left lower limb, with subsequent generalization. The presence of a rapid progression, the presence of startle response, the disproportion between the amount of pain and the degree of the dystonic posturing and the striking hypersensitivity to the SSRIs, are all red flags that make us rethink the initial diagnosis.

AB  - Objective: To build a platform in order to investigate the clinical spectrum of stiff person syndrome and related disorders, and to explore possible gaps in management and areas for further research. Background(s): Stiff person syndrome and related disorders (stiff person spectrum disorders, SPSD) are a very rare group of autoimmune movement disorders with an estimated prevalence of 1/1 000 000. Whereas the classical variant is associated with GAD-antibodies and manifests with predominant lumbar stiffness, the clinical and serological spectrum has broadened to include a wider range of phenotypes and antibodies. Method(s): The survey started in 03/2018 and is conducted amongst the members of the MDS rare movement disorders study group. Result(s): The survey is ongoing and at the time of abstract submission we report the first preliminary results. So far, 16 patients from 3 centres (UK, Argentina, Spain) were included (9 female) with a follow up time of 10 years on average (range 2-28). Median age of onset was 52.5yrs (range 29-68). Most patients (68,8%) had focal stiffness at onset and manifested with (painful) cramps (62.5%), axial stiffness (56,3%). Cerebellar signs (nystagmus, ataxia) or bulbar involvement occurred in 18.8%, respectively. 12.5% of patients displayed myoclonus at presentation, whereas prominent autonomic signs or epilepsy were rare (6,3% and none). Most of the patients harboured GADantibodies (93.8%), and concomitant autoimmunity was frequent (56.3%). Two cases were possibly paraneoplastic, as neurological symptoms occurred in close temporal relationship with cancers (oral squamous cell carcinoma, nasopharyngeal). Treatment approaches and outcomes were similar across the different centres. All but 1 patient received immunotherapy, most frequently intravenous immunoglobulins (87.5%) and plasma exchange (43,8%). Other immunotherapies used were steroids and rituximab (12.5% each), and azathioprine (6.3%). In 50%, a combination of at least two immunotherapy approaches was required. With treatment, half of the cases improved and a third remained stable. Conclusion(s): This is the first international multicentre SPSD study with prospective data collection by movement disorder experts. Further plans include expanding this cohort and, using a health services approach, identifying unmet needs in SPSD and areas for further research.

AB  - Objective: Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a spectrum of rare autoimmune neurological disorders with a manifestation of muscle rigidity and episodic muscle spasms. Stiff limb syndrome (SLS) is a rare variant of SPS that is more localized. These disorders are typically acquired, progressive, fluctuating, and commonly occur in young women aged 30-50 years. In this report, we present an atypical case of an elderly woman who presented with bilateral leg muscle rigidity and ultimately diagnosed with SLS. Background(s): A 79-year-old woman presented with progressive bilateral leg weakness and cramps for three days resulting in multiple falls. On physical examination she was found to have hyperreflexia, increased gastrocnemius tone, as well as spasticity and plantarflexion in both legs. Diagnostic work-up including imaging of the neuraxis and complete infectious and malignancy work-up was unremarkable. Titers of antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) were elevated at 124,000 U/mL (normal 0-5 U/mL). The patient was diagnosed with SLS and subsequently started on a benzodiazepine with significant improvement in her symptoms. Design/Methods: NA Results: SLS is an emerging entity that is considered a focal form of SPS in which the symptoms are confined to a distal limb, usually the legs. Our review of the literature revealed that the SPSrelated spectrum disorders such as SLS has not been reported in the elderly. SPS and its variants are suspected to be related to autoantibodies to the GAD enzyme, although the pathophysiology remains poorly understood. SLS may potentially be a distinct entity from SPS with several overlapping clinical features and diagnostic findings. Conclusion(s): Our case report describes a patient who presented with focal neurological symptoms and eventually diagnosed with SLS, confirmed by autoimmune work-up. We advise clinicians to be aware of this rare entity and pursue the appropriate work-up when the clinical suspicion is high, including the elderly population.

AB  - Objective: To estimate the prevalence of neurological anti-GAD autoimmunity in Martinique (French West Indies) on January 1 2016. Background(s): Anti-Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase antibodies (anti-GAD abs) have been lately associated with rare heterogeneous neurological syndromes. Within anti-GAD autoimmunity, prevalence of Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) is only known and estimated to be about 1 to 2 cases per 10 inhabitants (inhab.). On the other hand, prevalence rates of Cerebellar Ataxia (CA), Late-Onset focal epilepsy (LOFE), Limbic Encephalitis (LE), Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) are unknown. Design/Methods: Data were collected from 1993 to February 2019. Patients were identified through hospitalized based medical records. Each included patient had neurological manifestations associated with high levels of anti-GAD abs. The primary end point was the calculation of the prevalence of all neurological syndromes associated with anti-GAD autoimmunity. Result(s): On January 1 2016, 21 patients had neurological syndromes associated with anti-GAD autoimmunity. The overall prevalence of anti-GAD auto-immunity was 55.78 cases per 10 (CI 95 % +/-23.85) inhab. Among those patients, 13 had SPS (prevalence = 34.53/10 (CI 95% +/-18.77) inhab.), 9 had CA (prevalence = 23.91/10 (CI 95% +/-15.62) inhab.), 6 had LOFE (prevalence = 15.94/10 (CI 95% +/-15.62) inhab.), 5 had LE (prevalence = 13.28/10 (CI 95% +/-11.64) inhab.), and 1 PERM (prevalence = 2.66/10 (CI 95% +/-5.21) inhab.). Conclusion(s): Our study is the first estimating prevalence of each neurological syndromes lying within the entire spectrum of anti-GAD auto-immunity. SPS prevalence in Martinique is 34 times higher to that previously reported elsewhere. Further studies are required focusing on frequency of anti-GAD autoimmunity in people of African ancestry.

AB  - Objective: We aimed to analyze clinical and immunologic features of a cohort of patients with stiff-person spectrum disorders (SPSD), who have been clinically managed by our group in recent years. Background(s): To date, the largest cohort of SPSD patients was analyzed in a work by Martinez- Hernandez et al. (2016) and included 121 subjects. No studies on SPSD have been conducted so far in Russia, and only single case reports have been published. Design/Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of health records of 11 patients diagnosed by our group with SPSD during the period of 2015-2018. All available demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were extracted from the health records together with the results of electromyographic and neuroimaging studies. Result(s): Out of 11 patients only 2 were men. The age-at-onset ranged from 35 to 69. The median of the time from the first symptom onset to the correct diagnosis was 28 months (13.5; 68). Nobody was referred with an initially diagnosed or suspected SPSD. The most frequent diagnostic 'masks' were 'degenerative spine disease' and 'somatoform disorder'. In most cases, stiffness distribution was quite typical. Most common first complaints included stiffness in lumbar region and thighs as well as painful muscle spasms. Ten patients were found to have serum antibodies to GAD65, 1 patient was negative for serum antibodies to both GAD65 and amphiphysin. In 4 subjects, symptomatic therapy only was enough to sufficiently improve clinical status. Conclusion(s): The demographic data are consistent with that published on SPSD. The time period from the first symptom onset to the conclusive diagnosis was even slightly shorter than that in the study by Rakocevic et al. (2019). Clinical and electromyographic features are of great importance given that occasional SPSD cases may be antibody-negative.

AB  - The aim of the present report is to show the effects of a clinical pilates-based physiotherapy training program on physical functioning, including balance ability, flexibility, muscle strength, and pain severity in a case with Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS). A 43-year-old female with a 3-year history of SPS participated in the study. Clinical pilates training exercises were performed two times per week during 8 weeks. Static balance was evaluated with One Leg Stance Test and Tandem Stance Test, dynamic balance with Functional Reach Test and lower extremity strength and endurance measured by 30-s Chair Stand Test. Berg Balance Scale was used to assess balance and fall risk, and Timed Up and Go Test was used to assess functional mobility. Pain evaluation was done by Pain Quality Assessment Scale. Flexibility was measured with tape measure, range of motion with goniometer and muscle strength with manual muscle test. Among the balance and functional mobility tests, progress has been observed in all tests, except for 30-s Chair Stand test. Improvements have been observed in patient's range of motion, flexibility, strength, pain and balance parameters.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurologic disorder, characterized by muscle rigidity and spasms. Anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD) antibodies are associated with the classic form of SPS, while antibodies against amphiphysin are associated with the paraneoplastic form of the disease. We present the case of a patient with paraneoplastic SPS, presenting with muscle cramps of lower extremities that progressed to severe muscle rigidity and spasms, associated with a right breast tumor and positive anti-Amphiphysin antibodies. Paraneoplastic SPS is a rare neurological disorder, challenging for the physicians both to diagnose and treat. Copyright © 2020

AB  - Introduction: Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a very rare neuromuscular autoimmune disorder characterized by rigidity, stiffness and weakness in axial or proximal limb muscles. SPS presenting with angioedema and urticarial rash is described. Case Description: A 48-year-old male with comorbidities including hypothyroidism, Sjogren's syndrome, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease presents with daily episodes of diffuse muscle spasms and pain, affecting his ability to ambulate. He also describes development of lip, hand and feet swelling episodes lasting 24-48 hours in duration with a diffuse erythematous, raised, pruritic, and burning rash. His social history and family history are non-contributory. Laboratory studies reveal normal C1 esterase inhibitor and function but a significantly elevated glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) level of > 250 IU/mL. On follow-up visit, examination reveals mild swelling of the extremities with fading lesions of urticaria noted diffusely on the skin. He is diagnosed with stiff-person syndrome presenting with angioedema and urticarial rash, placed on high-dose antihistamines, and referred to neurology for electromyography with nerve conduction study and possible diazepam trial. A future trial of IVIG is considered. His angioedema and urticaria partially respond to high-dose antihistamines. Discussion(s): This case demonstrates an interesting presentation of a very rare disease. Given that stiff-person syndrome can be associated with type 1 diabetes and autoimmunity, our patient's history of Sjogren's syndrome and diabetes combined with his classic clinical features and very high GAD65 all suggest this diagnosis. This in combination with angioedema and urticaria is a unique presentation not documented in the literature.Copyright © 2020

AB  - BACKGROUND: Antiglutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)-associated neurologic disorders are rare, with varied presentations, including stiff-person syndrome (SPS) and cerebellar ataxia (CA). Vestibular and ocular motor (VOM) dysfunction can be the main presentation in a subset of patients. METHOD(S): Retrospective review of the Johns Hopkins Hospital medical records from 1997 to 2018 identified a total of 22 patients with a diagnosis of anti-GAD-associated SPS or CA who had detailed VOM assessments. Eight had prominent VOM dysfunction at the initial symptom onset and were referred to neurology from ophthalmology or otolaryngology ("early dominant"). Fourteen patients had VOM dysfunction that was not their dominant presentation and were referred later in their disease course from neurology to neuro-ophthalmology ("nondominant"). We reviewed clinical history, immunological profiles, and VOM findings, including available video-oculography. RESULT(S): In the 8 patients with early dominant VOM dysfunction, the average age of symptom onset was 53 years, and 5 were men. The most common symptom was dizziness, followed by diplopia. Seven had features of CA, and 4 had additional features of SPS. None had a structural lesion on brain MRI accounting for their symptoms. The most common VOM abnormalities were downbeating and gaze-evoked nystagmus and saccadic pursuit. All received immune therapy and most received symptomatic therapy. Most experienced improvement in clinical outcome measures (modified Rankin scale and/or timed 25-foot walk test) or VOM function. By contrast, in the 14 patients in whom VOM dysfunction was nondominant, most had an SPS phenotype and were women. VOM abnormalities, when present, were more subtle, although mostly still consistent with cerebellar and/or brainstem dysfunction. CONCLUSION(S): Individuals with anti-GAD-associated neurologic disorders may present with prominent VOM abnormalities at the initial symptom onset that localize to the cerebellum and/or brainstem. In our cohort, immune and symptomatic therapies improved clinical outcomes and symptomatology.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurological disorder that causes muscle rigidity and stiffness of the trunk and proximal limb muscles, leading to movement difficulties and impaired function. Due to the rarity of the disease, studies on the benefit of rehabilitation for this disorder are quite limited. A 46-year-old female patient diagnosed with SPS complained of imbalance and movement difficulty. We prescribed therapeutic exercises aimed to reduce the stiffness of the trunk and proximal limbs and improve her function. Baseline measurement of the patient's range of motion, muscle power and tone, balance and functional abilities were taken pre- and post-program. Outcome measures showed a general improvement in the patient's muscle flexibility, balance, and functionality.Copyright © 2020 Georg Thieme Verlag. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: We aimed to characterize the spectrum of clinical features and examination findings in pediatric-onset stiff person syndrome. Method(s): Medical records were reviewed for all patients treated for stiff person syndrome with symptom onset in childhood at a tertiary medical center between March 2001 and February 2019. Result(s): Of the 15 individuals who met inclusion criteria, 11 (73%) were female and 13 (87%) were Caucasian. Median age at symptom onset was 14.8 years (range 8.4 to 16.9), and median latency from symptom onset to diagnosis was 6.2 years (range 0.4 to 15.0). Nine individuals (60%) were not diagnosed until adulthood. The most common presenting features were painful spasms (n = 12, 80%), hyper-reflexia (n = 11, 73%), axial rigidity (n = =9, 60%), lower extremity rigidity or spasticity (n = 8, 53%), gait abnormalities (n = 6, 40%), and hyperlordosis (n = 6, 40%). Other noted features included anxiety (n = 5, 33%), dysautonomia (n = 3, 20%), and cranial neuropathies (n = 3, 20%). Personal (n = 9, 60%) and family history (n = 9, 60%) of autoimmune conditions was common. Serum antiglutamate decarboxylase 65 antibodies were found in 13 individuals (87%). Nearly all individuals received immunotherapy (n = 14, 93%), symptomatic medications (n = 15, 100%), and nonpharmacologic therapies (n = 14, 93%). However, most had persistent physical limitations, particularly impaired walking (n = 7, 47%) and inability to carry out previous activities (n = 14, 93%). Conclusion(s): There is a wide spectrum of typical and less common features seen in individuals with pediatric-onset stiff person syndrome. Despite symptom onset in childhood, diagnosis is often delayed until adulthood, at which point disability accrual is frequently seen. Early recognition is vital to address symptoms and may potentially limit future disability.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - McArdle disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of muscle glycogen metabolism that presents with pain and fatigue during exercise. Stiff-Person Syndrome is an autoimmune-related neurologic process characterized by fluctuating muscle rigidity and spasm. Reported is a 41-year-old male who presented to the emergency department due to sudden-onset weakness and chest pain while moving his refrigerator at home. Cardiac workup was non-contributory, but a creatine kinase level > 6,000 warranted a muscle biopsy. The biopsy pathology report was misinterpreted to be diagnostic for McArdle disease given the clinical presentation. After 4 years of treatment without symptomatic improvement, a gradual transition of symptoms from pain alone to pain with stiffness was noted. A positive glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody test resulted in a change of diagnosis to Stiff-Person Syndrome. This is the first known case that highlights the similarities between these two rare and distinct disease processes, highlighting the necessity for thorough history taking, maintenance of a broad differential diagnosis, and knowledge of how best to interpret complex pathology reports.© Copyright © 2020 Godbe, Malaty, Wenzel, Nazeer, Grider and Kinsey.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome is a neuroimmunological disorder characterized by progressive muscular rigidity and spasms that affect axial/limb muscles, resulting in severe pain and functional limitations. When refractory to conservative treatments, intrathecal baclofen is a viable option to treat the increased tone. Intrathecal baclofen has been shown to accelerate underlying neuromuscular scoliosis in the pediatric population with cerebral palsy. This adverse effect has never been reported in adults with stiff person syndrome. We report a case of an adult with stiff person syndrome and underlying scoliosis who experienced accelerated progression of scoliosis after initiation of intrathecal baclofen, subsequently requiring neurosurgical intervention.Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome is a rare condition characterised by prolonged stiffness with superimposed muscle spasms. Immunotherapy relies mainly on intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids and plasma exchange. Azathioprine or rituximab are other possible options. We describe two patients who showed a good clinical response with intravenous immunoglobulin and persistence of the clinical improvement after shifting to equivalent dosage of subcutaneous immunoglobulin. Both patients received a diagnosis of stiff person syndrome based on their clinical symptoms (episodes of stiffness and spasms) and presence of antiglutamic acid decarboxylase. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin was started with improvement of symptoms as reported by patients and confirmed also by the spasm frequency scale and modified Ashworth scale. After clinical stabilisation in order to avoid the hospitalisation required for intravenous immunoglobulin treatment a switch to subcutaneous immunoglobulins was made. After one year of follow-up from the switch, the patients show clinical stability. Their scores on the modified Ashworth scale, spasm frequency scale and on the 10 Meter Walking Test were also stable. Subcutaneous formulation of immunoglobulin could be as effective as intravenous immunoglobulin in the maintenance treatment of Stiff person syndrome, although studies involving a larger cohort of patients are needed in order to confirm our anecdotal experience.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - "Rigid" lower back pain: A case of stiff person syndrome
AU  - Aurore V.

PD  - /
AB  - Case description: A 61-year-old woman known for Hashimoto thyroidi-tis was referred to our Rheumatology department for non-specific low back pain (LBP). Truncal rigidity, progressive scoliosis, severe hyper-lordosis persisting during trunk flexion, and episodic muscle spasms elic-ited by physical or emotional stress were keystone symptoms and signs. Besides, an electromyogram had shown constant lumbar paraspinal muscular activity. This presentation suggests the diagnosis of Stiff Per-son Syndrome (SPS), a rare auto-immune disease linked to anti-glu-tamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (anti-GAD). High-level of anti-GAD confirmed the diagnosis and a favourable evolution was noted with diaz-epam 3x2 mg/j. Physiopathology and diagnosis: Anti-GAD are marker of SPS, but are also present in a few other neurological diseases. Physiopathology hy-pothesis suggests modulation of the neurotransmitter GABA enhancing spinal motor neurons hyperexcitability and unintentional co-contractions of agonist and antagonist muscles. Association with auto-immune disor-ders is known. Variants can present as stiff limb, or paraneoplasic syn-dromes. Differential diagnosis includes non-specific LBP, spondyloar-thropathy and extrapyramidal diseases. No definite consensus on diag-nostic criteria has been defined; a combination of clinical presentation (axial/limbs muscular rigidity, spasms), electromyogram (co-contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles), positive anti-GAD and test treatment with diazepam contributes to diagnosis. Treatment and prognosis: LBP and disability due to limited movement cause gait difficulties and falls. A recently published series reported a poor prognosis, as 80% lost the ability to walk independently on an 8 years follow up. Diazepam is the first line empirical treatment along with physiotherapy. Other agonist (eg. baclofen) or antiepileptic drugs are also proposed. In case of resistance to symptomatic therapies, immune modulating treatments are recommended. IVIG has the best evidence with a small positive randomized controlled trial. A few case series of Rituximab and plasma exchange reported rather disappointing results. Conclusion(s): SPS is a rare and challenging diagnosis in patient present-ing with chronic LBP. Classic red flags fail to provide clinical clues to the diagnosis, however recurrent spasm elicited by stress and hyperlordosis should alert rheumatologists. Recognition of this disease is of paramount importance to guide treatment approach.

AB  - We describe a patient with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who noticed pain and stiffness in the neck and painful spasms and rigidity of the right thigh. Continuous motor unit activity was recorded in the lower limb muscles on the right side and in the cervical paraspinal muscles. Cutaneomuscular reflexes were at an abnormally low threshold recording from the muscles of the right leg. Laboratory investigation revealed anti-GAD antibodies in serum and oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid. We conclude that the patient has atypical stiff-person syndrome.

AB  - Stiffness and spasticity are common neurologic symptoms that affect limb movements. We describe a patient who presented with ill-defined stiffness and an exaggerated startle response, who on serial examinations had variable degrees of stiffness and marked hyperreflexia but with plantar flexor signs. Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) was considered when axial stiffness became evident and was confirmed with highly elevated anti-GAD antibody titers. A favorable response to a short course of intravenous immunoglobulin treatment was sustained for more than 10 months, an unusual feature to the disease. We review the clinical features, pathologic mechanism, and treatment of this disorder.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Stiff limb syndrome is a clinical feature of the stiff person syndrome, which is a rare and disabling neurologic disorder characterized by muscle rigidity and episodic spasms that involve axial and limb musculature. It is an autoimmune disorder resulting in a malfunction of aminobutyric acid mediated inhibitory networks in the central nervous system. We describe a patient diagnosed by neurological symptoms of stiff limb syndrome with a good outcome after treatment, and a review of the related literature., CASE PRESENTATION: A 49-year-old male patient presented with a progressive stiffness and painful spasms of his both legs resulting in a difficulty of standing up and walking. The diagnosis of stiff limb syndrome was supported by the dramatically positive response to treatment using diazepam 25 mg/day and baclofen 30 mg/day., CONCLUSION: This clinical case highlights the importance of a therapeutic test to confirm the diagnosis of stiff limb syndrome especially when there is a high clinical suspicion with unremarkable electromyography.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: First described in 1956, stiff person syndrome is characterized by episodes of slowly progressive stiffness and rigidity in both the paraspinal and limb muscles. Although considered a rare disorder, stiff person syndrome is likely to be under-diagnosed due to a general lack of awareness of the disease in the medical community., CASE PRESENTATION: A 27-year-old Hispanic woman presented to our emergency department with a sudden onset of shortness of breath and difficulty moving her right arm. Her physical examination was remarkable in that her abdomen was firm to palpation and her right upper extremity was rigid on passive and active ranges of motion. Her right fingers were clenched in a fist. Her electromyography findings were consistent with stiff person syndrome in the right clinical setting. Stiff person syndrome is confirmed by testing for the anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody. Her test for this was positive., CONCLUSION: Stiff person syndrome may not be a common condition. However, if disregarded in the differential diagnosis, it can lead to several unnecessary tests being carried out causing a delay in treatment. This case report reveals some of the characteristic features of stiff person syndrome with an atypical presentation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is manifested by fluctuating rigidity of axial musculature with painful episodic spasms due to simultaneous co-contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles. We present a case report and video illustrating response to treatment with rituximab., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Case description and video are provided. A literature search for other reports of treatment with rituximab was performed., RESULTS: Nine cases in addition to our case were described. Substantial clinical benefit was reported in 7/9 (78%) cases. Four out of 9 (44%) cases displayed persistent anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody positivity., CONCLUSION: Rituximab is an important treatment strategy in SPS. The persistence of anti-GAD antibody positivity even with clinical remission remains to be elucidated.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare disorder, characterized by progressive fluctuating muscular rigidity and spasms. Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody is primarily involved in the pathogenesis of SPS and SPS is strongly associated with other autoimmune disease. Here we report three cases of patients with classical SPS finally confirmed by high serum level of GAD antibodies. All of our patients respond favorably to gamma amino butyric acid-enhancing drugs and immunotherapies.

AB  - Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS), is a very rare neuroimmunologic disorder characterized by progressive muscle pain, rigidity, stiffness, and spasms. It can be very debilitating if misdiagnosed or not recognized in time. Herein we discuss a case of a female in her 20s who presented with an unsteady gait, lower extremity weakness, persistent leg pain, and stiffness few weeks after uncomplicated childbirth. She has type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) and was diagnosed with thyroiditis in the course of her illness. The triad of thyroiditis, DM, and stiffness with normal neuroimaging in a young female patient is an unusual occurrence.

AB  - Background. Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by progressive rigidity of axial and limb muscles associated with painful spasms. SPS can be classified into classic SPS, paraneoplastic SPS, and SPS variants. Its underlying pathogenesis is probably autoimmune, as in most cases antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are observed. Similarly, paraneoplastic SPS is usually linked to anti-amphiphysin antibodies. Treatment is based on drugs enhancing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission and immunomodulatory agents. Case Series. Patient 1 is a 45-year-old male affected by the classic SPS, Patient 2 is a 73-year-old male affected by paraneoplastic SPS, and Patient 3 is a 68-year-old male affected by the stiff limb syndrome, a SPS variant where symptoms are confined to the limbs. Symptoms, diagnostic findings, and clinical course were extremely variable in the three patients, and treatment was often unsatisfactory and not well tolerated, thus reducing patient compliance. Clinical manifestations also included some unusual features such as recurrent vomiting and progressive dysarthria. Conclusions . SPS is a rare disorder that causes significant disability. Because of its extensive clinical variability, a multitask and personalized treatment is indicated. A clearer understanding of uncommon clinical features and better-tolerated therapeutic strategies are still needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: "Classic" stiff person syndrome (SPS) features stiffness, anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD) antibodies, and other findings. Anti-GAD antibodies are also detected in some neurological syndromes (such as ataxia) in which stiffness is inconsistently present. Patients with otherwise "classic" SPS may either lack anti-GAD antibodies or be seropositive for others. Hence, SPS cases appear to fall within a clinical spectrum that includes conditions such as progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM), which exhibits brainstem and autonomic features. We have compiled herein SPS-spectrum cases reported since 2010, and have segregated them on the basis of likely disease mechanism (autoimmune, paraneoplastic, or cryptogenic) for analysis., METHODS: The phrases "stiff person syndrome", "PERM", "anti-GAD antibody syndrome", and "glycine receptor antibody neurological disorders" were searched for in PubMed in January 2015. The results were narrowed to 72 citations after excluding non-English and duplicate reports. Clinical descriptions, laboratory data, management, and outcomes were categorized, tabulated, and analyzed., RESULTS: Sixty-nine autoimmune, 19 paraneoplastic, and 13 cryptogenic SPS-spectrum cases were identified. SPS was the predominant diagnosis among the groups. Roughly two-thirds of autoimmune and paraneoplastic cases were female. Anti-GAD antibodies were most frequently identified, followed by anti-amphiphysin among paraneoplastic cases and by anti-glycine receptor antibodies among autoimmune cases. Benzodiazepines were the most commonly used medications. Prognosis seemed best for cryptogenic cases; malignancy worsened that of paraneoplastic cases., DISCUSSION: Grouping SPS-spectrum cases by pathophysiology provided insights into work-up, treatment, and prognosis. Ample phenotypic and serologic variations are present within the categories. Ruling out malignancy and autoimmunity is appropriate for suspected SPS-spectrum cases.

AB  - A 9-year-old female child presented with a history of falls, weight loss, diffuse leg pain, and progressive gait disorder, following 1 previous event described as a tonic-clonic seizure. She had increased thyroid volume, brisk symmetric reflexes, abnormal gait, and painful spasms of the paraspinal musculature. Thyroid function tests indicated biochemical hyperthyroidism, and thyrotropin receptor antibodies were positive. Her electromyography showed continuous activation of normal motor units of the paraspinal and proximal lower extremity muscles. The patient had a diagnosis of Graves' disease with associated stiff-person syndrome, with elevated anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody levels. After intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, her ambulation was substantially improved and the symptoms of stiff-person syndrome decreased dramatically.

The patient subsequently had a complicated clinical course, developing refractory status epilepticus, which lead to the eventual diagnosis of progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM). We discuss the clinical similarities and differences between NMS and PERM, and highlight the need to consider alternative diagnoses when the clinical picture of NMS is atypical, particularly in this patient group where the history and clinical examination may be challenging.

AB  - Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurological disorder that primarily affects the ability to relax musculature. This results in affected muscle groups remaining in constant contracture, leading to painful spasms that have significant morbidity and impact the patient's quality of life. Disease prevalence is one to two persons in a million, and as a result, very few randomized controlled studies have examined the efficacy of various treatment regimens. One notable study examined intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and its efficacy in the treatment of SPS. This study found that using IVIG was of significant benefit in improving stiffness in SPS. However, beyond this, immune modulating therapy is limited by lack of peer-reviewed evidence. The use of rituximab has been reported in cases of SPS that are refractory to treatment with IVIG and has had mixed outcomes. Our search of the literature involved examining case reports of patients with diagnosed SPS, who had been initially treated with the standard of care and were then placed on treatment with rituximab. Our review of the available case reports demonstrates an increase in SPS remission correlating with the frequency of dose. However, the limited number of case reports available limits conclusions related to the treatment of SPS. More studies are needed to assist in guiding therapy for SPS.

AB  - Anxiety disorder is a commonly used diagnosis that may mask underlying conditions. Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neuroimmunological disorder characterized by progressive rigidity and painful muscle spasms affecting axial and lower extremity musculature. These episodes can be triggered by sudden movement, noise, or emotional stress, which may present as a psychiatric condition. We report the case of a 30-year-old female who presented with recurrent panic attacks with multiple prior hospital admissions for anxiety, rigidity, and difficulty in walking. Previous electroencephalogram (EEG) and brain and cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were unremarkable. She was empirically treated with diazepam and beta-blockers for SPS, which was confirmed by positive glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies. The patient's symptoms became refractory to benzodiazepines and required steroids with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Her rigidity subsequently responded to plasmapheresis. In SPS, antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) most commonly target the GAD antigen on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons. The goal of treatment is to ameliorate symptoms and improve quality of life. Our case of SPS was masked as generalized anxiety disorder for at least six years since onset of symptoms. The criteria for both diagnoses may overlap as seen in this patient.

AB  - Background: Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurologic disorder characterized by muscle rigidity. It is a disorder of reduced GABA activity leading to increased muscle tone and often painful spasms. It generally presents in the axial musculature but rarely can involve only one limb, typically a lower extremity. In rare cases it can be paraneoplastic which generally resolves on treatment of the underlying neoplasm., Case Report: A 46-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's Lymphoma in remission presented with left upper extremity pain secondary to a diagnosis of Stiff Person Syndrome limited to his left upper extremity. He had previously benefitted from plasmapheresis and was on diazepam and baclofen at home with relatively good control of his symptoms. SPS had previously been diagnosed with EMG and anti-GAD-65 antibody titers and was confirmed by an elevated anti-GAD-65 antibody titer. He was treated with plasmapheresis and maximum doses of medical treatment including botulinum toxin with only transient mild improvement in his symptoms., Conclusion: This case represents a case of a rare disease that was refractory to all known therapies. It outlines the need for further understanding of this disorder in order to provide better symptomatic treatment or potentially more definitive care.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare disorder that affects the central nervous system and is characterized by progressive muscle stiffness, rigidity, and spasm of axial and limb muscles. The syndrome is caused by a lack of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), which occurs because of antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), an essential enzyme for GABA synthesis. Hence, the patients present with increased muscular activity. In this article, we will discuss two case studies of stiff-person syndrome. Copyright © 2017, Siddiqui et al.

AB  - Background: Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by axial muscle rigidity and involuntary spasms. Autoimmune and neoplastic diseases are associated with SPS. Our study objectives were to describe inpatient care for SPS in the United States and characterize 30-day readmissions., Methods: We queried the 2014 Nationwide Readmission Database for hospitalizations where a diagnosis of SPS was recorded. For readmission analyses, we excluded encounters with missing length of stay, hospitalization deaths, and out-of-state and December discharges. National estimates of index hospitalizations and 30-day readmissions were computed using survey weighting methods. Unconditional logistic regression was used to examine associations between demographic, clinical, and hospital characteristics and readmission., Results: There were 836 patients with a recorded diagnosis of SPS during a 2014 hospitalization. After exclusions, 703 patients remained, 9.4% of which were readmitted within 30 days. Frequent reasons for index hospitalization were SPS (27.8%) and diabetes with complications (5.1%). Similarly, readmissions were predominantly for diabetes complications (24.2%) and SPS. Most readmissions attributed to diabetes complications (87.5%) were to different hospitals. Female sex (OR, 3.29; CI: 1.22-8.87) and routine discharge (OR, 0.26; CI: 0.10-0.64) were associated with readmission, while routine discharge (OR, 0.18; CI: 0.04-0.89) and care at for-profit hospitals (OR, 10.87; CI: 2.03-58.25) were associated with readmission to a different hospital., Conclusions: Readmissions in SPS may result from disease complications or comorbid conditions. Readmissions to different hospitals may reflect specialty care, gaps in discharge planning, or medical emergencies. Studies are required to determine if readmissions in SPS are preventable.

AB  - Anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD) antibody syndrome (aGAS) has various presentations including cerebellar ataxia (CA) and stiff person syndrome (SPS). This is a treatable cause of CA and SPS. We present a case of a 49-year-old man who developed blurred vision, slurred speech, difficulty walking, unsteady gait, and clumsiness which had progressed over four months. The patient was found to have anti-GAD ab (+) CA and SPS and experienced significant symptomatic improvements after treatment with intravenous (IV) steroids followed by intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). The patient's improvement persisted when he was reevaluated at follow up one month later. Since anti-GAD ab related diseases, including anti-GAD CA and SPS, are rarely diagnosed, there is limited data regarding the treatment of this condition. As there are only a few cases in the literature similar to this one, highlighting the successful treatment of anti-GAD ab cerebellar ataxia and SPS with dual therapy (steroids followed by IVIG) is important.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is an uncommon neurological disorder characterized by significant rigidity and muscle spasms primarily affecting the truncal and proximal musculature. Furthermore, a wide-based gait with functional impairment is generally seen. High-dose benzodiazepines or baclofen are widely considered the optimal initial therapy; however, major adverse effects often preclude adequate dosing. Refractory cases may be treated with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), plasma exchange, or B-cell depletion with rituximab, although these are also associated with major, sometimes fatal, adverse reactions. Several reports have validated the safety and utility of botulinum injections in this setting, yet botulinum remains markedly underutilized in this cohort. Below, a case report and review of the literature show botulinum can decrease pain and stiffness, improve gait and balance, and decrease dependence on powerful systemic treatments in this group.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS), with a prevalence of one to two per million, is an extremely rare neurological condition that is characterized by axial muscle stiffness and rigidity along with intermittent painful muscle spasms. It is often associated with psychiatric co-morbidities such as anxiety and depression. The pathophysiology, although poorly understood, is widely believed to be autoimmune in nature due to the association of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase-65 (anti-GAD 65) antibodies with this condition. There is also a paraneoplastic variant that is more commonly associated with anti-ampiphysin antibodies. It occurs most commonly in patients with breast cancer followed by colon cancer. Most of the practising neurologists encounter just one or two cases of SPS in their entire careers, hence this condition remains underdiagnosed, leading to significant disability and distress to the patient. In this case report we describe a postmenopausal female who presented initially with symptoms of vertigo and dizziness and was hospitalized multiple times before the diagnosis was reached. Through this article, we attempt to increase awareness about this condition among practising physicians so as to increase the likelihood of earlier diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare, autoimmune, neuromuscular disorder that manifests with axial and proximal muscle stiffness, rigidity, and painful muscle spasms, often causing progressive disability due to limited movement. First-line therapies comprise symptomatic management with gamma-aminobutyric acid-modulating drugs such as benzodiazepines and baclofen. Patients resistant to these treatments are often given intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). Severe disease refractory to first-line therapy and IVIg may be treated with therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) or immunomodulatory agents such as rituximab. Current evidence derived from case reports and case series has shown that roughly half of SPS patients treated with TPE report benefits. Here, we report the case of a 68-year-old man with a 20-year history of severe SPS and recurrent falls who was admitted to the emergency department for a traumatic hip fracture. He had significant rigidity in the axial and extremity muscles with persistent spasms of the quadriceps femoris muscle. Postoperatively, he was unable to participate in physical therapy (PT) due to these symptoms. He previously failed treatment with diazepam, baclofen, and monthly IVIg. Under our care, he underwent seven TPE treatments. By the end of treatment, he reported significant improvement in mobility with a resolution of muscle spasms and was able to be discharged to inpatient rehabilitation. This suggests that TPE may offer an effective, safe treatment modality for patients with severe refractory SPS that may significantly improve mobility and disability associated with the disease.

AB  - Aim: To report a case of sudden onset vertical diplopia, blurred vision, and muscle spasms., Methods: This is a case report of a 57-year-old female who presented to the accident and emergency department with a one day history of vertical diplopia and a two week history of lower limb spasticity secondary to muscle spasms., Results: The patient had no significant medical or ocular history. Orthoptic investigation initially revealed a left inferior rectus (IR) underaction. Possible diagnoses at this point were thought to be isolated IR weakness, myasthenia gravis or skew deviation. An urgent MRI scan was arranged and blood tests were taken. MRI showed no abnormalities. Blood tests were normal, however, the acetylcholine receptor antibody serum test (ACH-R) was 0.43 nmol/L, which is at the high end of normal. At the follow-up visit, the IR weakness had deteriorated and the patient had also developed gaze-evoked nystagmus. An appointment with the neurologist and neuro-ophthalmologist was expedited. When the patient returned, she reported that her neurologist had diagnosed her with stiff-person syndrome (SPS). The patient had also developed a laterally alternating skew deviation and reported that she had undergone a course of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). The patient was prescribed diazepam and gabapentin. Due to the lack of recovery, persistent diplopia and oscillopsia, monthly IVIG have been prescribed., Conclusion: There is currently a paucity of literature relating to ophthalmic problems with SPS and how they are best treated. Previous reports have established that there is a link with myasthenia gravis, with many patients going on to develop myasthenia. Treatment of SPS is lacking large evidence-based studies. However, treatment with muscle relaxants and anticonvulsants has provided a good outcome for some. Further research is required to develop an evidence-based approach to treating the ophthalmological problems patients with SPS experience. This case report highlights the importance and value of orthoptists in investigating and monitoring patients with stiff-person syndrome. Copyright: © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - RATIONALE: Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is an uncommon neurological disorder with autoimmune features. Here, we report a 60-year-old man with SPS associated with critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP). CIP was diagnosed during an episode of acute respiratory failure secondary to muscular rigidity and spasms, which has rarely been reported in this condition. The overlapping of CIP and SPS complicated the case., PATIENT CONCERNS: A 60-year-old man presented with gradual onset of cramps, stiffness, and rigidity in his lower limbs 1 year before admission, which eventually led to inability to stand and walk. The persistent nature of his symptoms progressed to frequent acute episodes of dyspnea and he was admitted to intensive care unit (ICU)., DIAGNOSIS: SPS had been diagnosed after 2 tests of electromyography (EMG) and the detection of an elevated anti-GAD65 antibody titer. During the first EMG, low or absent compound muscle action potentials (CMAP), and sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP) were shown. Therefore, the diagnosis of SPS coexisting with CIP was made., INTERVENTIONS: Symptomatic treatment was initiated with oral clonazepam (0.5 mg Bid) and baclofen (5 mg Bid). Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (0.4 g/kg/d) was administered for the patient for 5 days after admission. We observed a significant clinical improvement during the administration period, and the patient became ambulatory., OUTCOMES: On follow-up, the patient reported complete relief of his pain and rigidity., LESSONS: We report this special case to address the varied clinical features of SPS. Electrophysiological testing is an important diagnostic approach. Accurate recognition of the disease ensures that the patients can be given appropriate treatment without delay.

AB  - RATIONALE: Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare neurological immune disorder characterized by progressive axial and proximal limb muscle rigidity, stiffness, and painful muscle spasms. Amphiphysin antibodies are positive in approximately 5% of SPS patients. To date, there have been no relevant reports on involuntary movement in cases of SPS with amphiphysin antibodies., PATIENT CONCERNS: We describe the case of a 69-year-old man with a 2-year history of progressive stiffness in the neck, bilateral shoulders, and chest muscles, and a more-than-a-year history of dyspnea accompanied by mandibular involuntary movement. The patient was a vegetarian and had good health in the past. The family's medical history was unremarkable., DIAGNOSES: He was diagnosed with SPS based on the progressive muscle stiffness, the amphiphysin antibody seropositivity, the continuous motor activity on electromyography, and the effective treatment with benzodiazepines., INTERVENTIONS: The patient was orally administered clonazepam and baclofen, and corticosteroid IV followed by prednisone orally., OUTCOMES: In the hospital, after treatment with methylprednisolone, clonazepam, and baclofen, the patient's rigidity, stiffness, and dyspnea significantly improved. The involuntary movement of the mandible persisted throughout the treatment process. Currently, under oral treatment with baclofen and clonazepam, the patient's symptoms of muscle stiffness and dyspnea exist, and follow-up is continued., LESSONS: We report a rare and novel case of involuntary movement in SPS with amphiphysin antibodies. The present report explores the relationship between SPS and involuntary movement and expands the spectrum of clinical manifestations of SPS. Copyright © 2021 the Author(s).

AB  - Stiff-Person syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune neurological disorder characterised by episodic painful muscle rigidity and violent spasms. A significant trigger for the painful spasms experienced by patients is pain itself, making optimal pain management and avoidance a necessity. While first-line and second-line therapies for spasm prevention and termination are known, there is a paucity of evidence to guide pain management. We report the case of a 26-year-old woman with SPS referred for excruciating muscle cramping and rigidity with pain lasting beyond the episodes themselves. We report the novel use of ketamine and intravenous magnesium sulfate which may provide analgesia, spasm avoidance and early termination of exacerbations in SPS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that autologous nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is safe and shows efficacy in the treatment of stiff-person spectrum disorder (SPSD)., METHODS: Twenty-three participants were treated in a prospective open-label cohort study of safety and efficacy. After stem cell mobilization with cyclophosphamide (2 g/m2) and filgrastim (5-10 microg/kg/d), participants were treated with cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) divided as 50 mg/kg IV on day -5 to day -2; rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (thymoglobulin) given intravenously at 0.5 mg/kg on day -5, 1 mg/kg on days -4 and -3, and 1.5 mg/kg on days -2, and -1 (total dose 5.5 mg/kg); and rituximab 500 mg IV on days -6 and +1. Unselected peripheral blood stem cells were infused on day 0. Safety was assessed by survival and National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria for adverse events during HSCT. Outcome was assessed by >=50% decrease or discontinuation of antispasmodic drugs and by quality of life instruments., RESULTS: There was no treatment-related mortality. One participant died 1 year after transplantation of disease progression. Of the 74% of participants who responded, 47% have stayed in remission for a mean of 3.5 years; 26% did not respond. Compared to nonresponders, responders were more likely to have pretransplantation intermittent muscle spasms (16 of 17 vs 0 of 6), normal reflexes (12 of 17 vs 0 of 6), and positive CSF anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase serology (12 of 14 vs 2 of 6). Compared to responders, nonresponders were more likely to have lead pipe rigidity (4 of 6 vs 0 of 17) and EMG-documented simultaneous contraction of agonist/antagonist limb muscles (4 of 6 vs 1 of 17). Pre-HSCT use of prescription serotonin selective receptor inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) was more common in those who relapsed or never responded (9 of 12) compared to those responders who never relapsed (0 of 11)., CONCLUSION: In this cohort, HSCT was safe, but the beneficial effect of HSCT was variable and confined predominately to participants with episodic spasms and normal tendon reflexes without simultaneous cocontraction of limb agonist/antagonist muscles who were not taking SSRI or SNRI antidepressants., CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence that, for a subset of people with SPSD, autologous nonmyeloablative HSCT improves outcomes., CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT02282514.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a neurologic disorder characterized by muscle stiffness, rigidity, and muscle spasms, and it can increase a patient's risk for falls. It is recognized as a rare disease with limited clinical guidelines to manage the condition and its symptoms. Currently, there is even less clinical guidance for the management of common comorbid conditions in these patients. This patient case report aims to evaluate the efficacy of various medications for symptom management in a patient with SPS and comorbid psychiatric disorders, specifically bipolar I and panic disorder. Throughout the patient's course of treatment, various medications were trialed, including fluoxetine, hydroxyzine, valproic acid, propranolol, and clonazepam. Ultimately, fluoxetine, hydroxyzine, and propranolol were discontinued due to adverse drug reactions and incomplete symptom resolution. The patient's bipolar I disorder was adequately managed with valproic acid. Once the clonazepam was changed from as-needed to scheduled dosing, the patient's panic disorder and anxiety-triggered spasms were well controlled. The efficacy of benzodiazepines, specifically high doses of diazepam, in alleviating muscle spasms and anxiety in SPS has been demonstrated in the literature. Case reports including patients with SPS that are prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors provide controversial evidence as some studies report exacerbation of SPS symptoms with prolonged use. As this case report and literature review suggest, patients with SPS and comorbid panic disorder and anxiety-triggered spasms may benefit from the use of benzodiazepines. The use of other medication classes for the treatment of other comorbid psychiatric disorders in a patient with SPS is lacking evidence. Copyright © 2020 CPNP.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare disorder seen in approximately one in one million people. Although it is rare, the symptoms and findings of a typical case should paint a clear clinical picture for those who are familiar with the disease. The primary findings in SPS include progressive axial muscle rigidity as well as muscle spasms. These symptoms most commonly occur in the setting of antibodies against Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase (GAD), the rate-limiting enzyme in the production of Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA), which is the primary inhibitory enzyme in the central nervous system. Here, we report the case of a 65-year-old African-American female with a past medical history of hypothyroidism, anxiety, and depression with psychotic features who presented with axial muscle rigidity and lactic acidosis. She had been symptomatic for several months and reported extensive workups performed at two previous hospitals without a definitive diagnosis. A complete neurological and musculoskeletal investigation yielded no positive findings except for the presence of GAD antibodies. The patient was treated with diazepam, tizanidine, and Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) with significant improvement, thus solidifying the diagnosis of SPS, a rare autoimmune and/or paraneoplastic syndrome.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus is characterized by rigidity, painful muscle spasms, hyperekplexia, and brainstem signs. Recently, glycine receptor alpha 1 antibodies have been described in adult patients with progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus. We describe a pediatric case., OBSERVATIONS: A 14-month-old child developed startle-induced episodes of generalized rigidity and myoclonus, axial hyperextension, and trismus, without impairment of consciousness. Episodes occurred during wakefulness and sleep, lasted seconds, and were accompanied by moaning, tachypnea, and oxygen desaturation. Imaging, cerebrospinal fluid, endocrine, metabolic, and genetic screening findings were normal or negative. She was treated with intravenous steroids and immunoglobulins with resolution of symptoms, but she relapsed weeks later. At this time, episodes were more severe. Glycine receptor alpha 1 antibodies were found in serum (titer of 1:200, later 1:320) and cerebrospinal fluid (titer of 1:2). Treatment was restarted with intravenous steroids and immunoglobulins, with major improvement, and she began treatment with oral steroids. She had 4 milder relapses, with improvement after treatment adjustments., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: To our knowledge, this is the first pediatric case of progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus associated with glycine receptor alpha 1 antibodies, a potentially severe but treatable antibody-mediated neurological disorder.

AB  - Glycine receptor (GlyR) antibodies have been identified in patients with rigidity and hyperekplexia, but the clinical phenotype associated with these antibodies has not been fully elucidated. The clinical features in two additional patients with GlyR antibodies are described. A 55-year-old man presented with stimulus-induced hyperekplexia and rigidity in the lower limbs and trunk. He initially responded to benzodiazepines, but presented after 18 months with severe, painful, prolonged spasms associated with supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, hypoventilation and oxygen desaturation requiring intubation. He improved following treatment with clonazepam, baclofen and immunomodulatory therapies. A 58-year-old woman presented with stiffness in the legs and hyperekplexia associated with hypoventilation, at times leading to loss of consciousness. She responded to benzodiazepines and has remained in remission. The clinical picture associated with GlyR antibodies includes autonomic dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmias and hypoventilation. It is important to recognise these serious complications early to limit mortality from this treatable condition. Crown Copyright © 2013. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune neurological disorder which is often misdiagnosed. We report here a case of SPS with a long diagnosis delay., CASE: A 36-year-old man presented with an 11-year history of progressive stiffness and painful spasms of his both legs, with recent worsening of his condition over the last year resulting in a considerable difficulty of standing up and walking. As the patient developed phobic symptoms, he was considered as having a psychiatric illness and treated with antianxiety and antidepressant drugs. As no real improvement was observed, the patient was referred to internal medicine. Neurological examination showed paraspinal, abdominal and lower limbs muscle contraction with lumbar rigidity. These symptoms were associated to adrenergic symptoms: profuse sweating, tachycardia and high bloodpressure. Initial routine investigations revealed high blood glucose level. Polygraphic electromyographic (EMG) evaluation from paraspinal and leg muscles showed continuous motor unit activity in agonist and antagonist muscle. Electroencephalography and brain magnetic resonance imaging were normal. Immunologic tests according to radio immune assay technique revealed high level of serum anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD65) antibodies. Diagnosis of autoimmune SPS was retained based on clinical, electrophysiological, and immunological findings. Pregabalin at the dose of 150 mg, three times a day was prescribed with satisfying response., CONCLUSION: SPS is supported by an autoimmune pathogenesis and anti-GAD antibodies seems to be very helpful when SPS is clinically suspected. Treatment of SPS is a challenge, given the scarcity of the syndrome and the absence of established recommendations.

AB  - A 34-year-old female with stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is reported in this paper. She experienced short-term memory impairment and was diagnosed with anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) autoimmune encephalitis (AE) at the local hospital. However, after the treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and high-dose glucocorticoids, her symptoms unchanged. Two months later, she was admitted to our hospital due to an unstable gait and persistent leg stiffness, at which point she was diagnosed as anti-GAD AE concomitant with SPS. Her clinical symptoms improved with an increased dose of ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-enhancing drug and plasma exchange. Anti-GAD antibody-associated AE combined with SPS is extremely rare. Treatment with GABA-enhancing drugs and appropriate immunotherapy can improve the neurological function of patients suffering from the combination of SPS and limbic encephalitis.

AB  - CASE: Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) presents with progressive muscle rigidity, postural instability, and periodic debilitating spasms. Reports of axial hyperextension exist, but kyphotic deformities have not been described. We surgically treated a patient with debilitating SPS and severe cervicothoracic hyperkyphosis with posterior spinal fusion and instrumentation. At 1-year follow-up, the patient displayed better upright gait and forward gaze, 18degree cervical lordosis, and improved patient-reported outcome scores., CONCLUSION: SPS can lead to extreme spinal deformity and disease, including hyperkyphosis of the cervicothoracic spine, and can successfully be managed with a multidisciplinary team and a posterior-only correction with spinal instrumentation and fusion.

AB  - Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) is a rare immune-mediated disabling neurological disorder characterised by muscle spasms and high GAD antibodies. There are only a few case reports of autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) as a treatment for SPS., OBJECTIVE: To describe the UK experience of treating refractory SPS with auto-HSCT., METHODS: Between 2015 and 2019, 10 patients with SPS were referred to our institution for consideration of auto-HSCT. Eight patients were deemed suitable for autograft and four were treated. Of the treated patients, three had classical SPS and one had the progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus variant. All patients were significantly disabled and had failed conventional immunosuppressive therapy. Patients were mobilised with Cyclophosphamide (Cy) 2 g/m2 + G-CSF and conditioned with Cy 200 mg/kg + ATG followed by auto-HSCT., RESULTS: Despite their significantly reduced performance status, all patients tolerated the procedure with no unexpected toxicities. Following autograft, all patients improved symptomatically and stopped all forms of immunosuppressive therapies. Two patients were able to ambulate independently from being wheelchair dependent. One patient's walking distance improved from 300 meters to 5 miles and one patient's ambulation improved from being confined to a wheelchair to be able to walk with a frame. Two patients became seronegative for anti-GAD antibodies and normalised their neurophysiological abnormalities., CONCLUSIONS: Auto-HSCT is an intensive but well tolerated and effective treatment option for patients with SPS refractory to conventional immunotherapy. Further work is warranted to optimise patient selection and establish the efficacy, long-term safety, and cost-effectiveness of this treatment.

AB  - The common co-occurrence of autoimmune systemic diseases in patients with neurological disorders and antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) suggests a shared genetic predisposition to these disorders. However, the nature and frequency of familial aggregation of autoimmune diseases, which might also support this hypothesis, have been poorly investigated. Herein, an exploratory, interview-based study was conducted with the aim of describing the autoimmune diseases displayed by the relatives of GAD65 neurological patients, their frequency, kinship, and potential patterns of inheritance. Patients were enrolled only if they had GAD65 antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid and typical clinical phenotypes associated with such antibodies (stiff-person syndrome, cerebellar ataxia, limbic encephalitis, or temporal lobe epilepsy). A total of 65 patients were included in the study, and 44/65 (67.7%) reported family history of autoimmunity, including first-degree relatives in 36/65 (55.4%); the sibling recurrence risk (lambdaS) was 5.5, reinforcing the hypothesis of an underlying strong genetic predisposition. Most pedigrees with familial autoimmunity (38/44, 86.4%) showed multiple autoimmune diseases, all but 2 of them with diabetes mellitus or autoimmune thyroid disease, therefore resembling autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes. Inheritance patterns were diverse, possibly autosomal dominant in 17/44 (38.6%) pedigrees or autosomal recessive in 5/44 (11.4%), and un-defined or complex in 24/44 (54.5%). However, a total of 21/65 (32.3%) patients had no identified family history of autoimmunity. In conclusion, these results suggest a variable and heterogeneous genetic predisposition to GAD65 neurological disorders, possibly involving multiple loci and modes of inheritance with different contribution in each family.

AB  - This report describes a 59-year-old woman who presented with progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM)-like symptoms and severe dysautonomia, including orthostatic hypotension, sinus bradycardia, dysuria, and prolonged constipation. Her neurological symptoms improved after immunotherapy, but the dysautonomia persisted. Anti-ganglionic acetylcholine receptor (gAChR) alpha3 subunit antibodies, which are frequently identified in patients with autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy, were detected in the pre-treatment serum. The central distribution of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, a target of anti-gAChR antibodies, and immunotherapeutic efficacy observed in this case indicate that anti-gAChR alpha3 subunit antibodies are associated with the PERM-like features accompanied by autonomic manifestations.

AB  - Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) is a rare and severe syndrome characterized by rigidity of the limb and truncal muscles, brainstem signs, myoclonus, and hyperekplexia. Iliopsoas hematoma is a serious complication of bleeding disorders that occurs most commonly in patients with hemophilia and also in association with anti-coagulant drug treatment. We herein present a case of PERM complicated with bilateral iliopsoas hematomas. His neurological symptoms improved after immunotherapy, and thereafter the iliopsoas hematomas disappeared. Neurologists should consider iliopsoas hematomas as a serious potential complication of PERM.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine clinical manifestations, immunotherapy responsiveness and outcomes of glutamic acid decarboxylase-65 (GAD65) neurological autoimmunity., METHODS: We identified 323 Mayo Clinic patients with high-titre (>20 nmol/L in serum) GAD65 antibodies out of 380 514 submitted anti-GAD65 samples (2003-2018). Patients classified as having GAD65 neurological autoimmunity after chart review were analysed to determine disease manifestations, immunotherapy responsiveness and predictors of poor outcome (modified Rankin score >2)., RESULTS: On review, 108 patients were classified as not having GAD65 neurological autoimmunity and 3 patients had no more likely alternative diagnoses but atypical presentations (hyperkinetic movement disorders). Of remaining 212 patients with GAD65 neurological autoimmunity, median age at symptom onset was 46 years (range: 5-83 years); 163/212 (77%) were female. Stiff-person spectrum disorders (SPSD) (N=71), cerebellar ataxia (N=55), epilepsy (N=35) and limbic encephalitis (N=7) could occur either in isolation or as part of an overlap syndrome (N=44), and were designated core manifestations. Cognitive impairment (N=38), myelopathy (N=23) and brainstem dysfunction (N=22) were only reported as co-occurring phenomena, and were designated secondary manifestations. Sustained response to immunotherapy ranged from 5/20 (25%) in epilepsy to 32/44 (73%) in SPSD (p=0.002). Complete immunotherapy response occurred in 2/142 (1%). Cerebellar ataxia and serum GAD65 antibody titre >500 nmol/L predicted poor outcome., INTERPRETATION: High-titre GAD65 antibodies were suggestive of, but not pathognomonic for GAD65 neurological autoimmunity, which has discrete core and secondary manifestations. SPSD was most likely to respond to immunotherapy, while epilepsy was least immunotherapy responsive. Complete immunotherapy response was rare. Serum GAD65 antibody titre >500 nmol/L and cerebellar ataxia predicted poor outcome. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

AB  - A case of stiff-man syndrome (SMS), a rare and dramatic CNS disease characterized by continuous muscle activity and painful spasms resembling a chronic form of tetanus, occurring in a patient with Hodgkin's disease (HD) is reported. The patient developed the clinical features of SMS at the same time as the HD relapse. A satisfactory improvement was obtained with diazepam, but the complete recovery from stiffness was achieved only after chemotherapy was started. Cerebellar autoantibodies were found in the serum of the patient. With chemotherapy the patient achieved a second complete remission (CR). Eighteen months later the patient developed a second HD relapse, and at that time no signs of SMS were detected.

AB  - Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PEWR) is a rare neurological disorder, characterised by muscular rigidity, painful spasms, myoclonus, and evidence of brain stem and spinal cord involvement. A 73-year-old white man was admitted with a 10-day history of painful muscle spasms and continuous muscle rigidity on his left lower limb. He had involuntary spasms on his legs and developed encephalopathy with cranial nerves signs and long tract spinal cord symptomatology. Brain CT scan and spinal MRI were normal. The CSF showed lymphocytic pleocytosis and no other abnormalities. EMG showed involuntary muscle activity with 2-6 seconds of duration, interval of 30-50 ms and a frequency of 2/second in the left lower limb. Anti-GAD antibodies were detected in the blood. We detected radiological signs of lung cancer during the follow-up, which proved to be an oat cell carcinoma. The patient died two weeks after the diagnosis of the cancer.

AB  - We reported a Stiff person syndrome (SPS) patient with elevated autoantibodies against cardiolipin and β2 glycoprotein 1 but without glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies. A 40-year male was admitted due to limited mouth opening for 1 week. His blood routine, biochemical, infectious diseases, tumor markers, radiographic examinations were all normal. At day 3 (D3) after admission, he developed paroxysmal systemic muscle rigidity. At D6, the on-duty physician occasionally gave oral clonazepam, which effectively relieved the symptom. At D13, the titers of cardiolipin and β2 glycoprotein 1 autoantibodies elevated but the remaining autoantibodies were all in normal ranges. After clonazepam treatment for 1 week, the symptoms were basically relieved, and the titers of these two antibodies returned to normal range with the relief of symptoms. During the 3 years of follow-up, the symptoms did not present again, and the titers of both antibodies were stable in the normal ranges. He had no tumor and other immune system diseases. In summary, we reported a SPS case with elevated cardiolipin and β2 glycoprotein 1 autoantibodies. The patient was highly responsive to clonazepam therapy, and had favorable outcome in the 3 years follow-up. Our report is helpful for better understand the heterogeneous feature of SPS.

AB  - Stiff leg syndrome (SLS) is considered as a focal form of stiff person syndrome (SPS) in which symptoms are confined to a distal limb. A patient with stiff leg syndrome developed a malignant neuroleptic syndrome (NMS) after having been treated with a single dose of haloperidol. She developed renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation, and died despite extensive treatment. The potential vulnerability of patients with SPS/SLS to NMS is discussed.

AB  - Thirteen patients with stiff-man syndrome (SMS) were studied with the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), the Self-Administered Alcoholism Screening Test (SAAST), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) profiles, and by telephone interview's. The mean MMPI, SAAST, and STAI were within normal limits: however; several patients had abnormal profiles. The results of telephone interviews revealed that 8 patients (62%) had been given at least 1 psychiatric diagnosis and 4 (31%) abused alcohol ol were dependent on it, Two patients had a psychiatric diagnosis that preceded the onset of symptoms of SMS. The authors hypothesize that SMS patients have a gamma-aminobutyric ic acid deficiency or GABAergic neuron dysfunction that leads to psychiatric symptoms, including depression and chemical abuse. Clinicians treating patients with SMS must be alert to the possible presence of comorbid psychiatric illnesses in this patient population.

AB  - A case of progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity (PEWR) associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is reported. A 58 year-old woman presented with a clinical picture of progressive quadriparesis, sensory loss, sphincter dysfunction, painful muscle spasms in the upper and lower limbs and continuous muscle unit activity in electromyography. She developed hepatitis, pancreatitis and HCV-RNA was detected in the plasma by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Postmortem histopathological examination showed encephalomyelitis with perivascular lymphocyte cuffing, infiltration and neuronal loss mainly affecting the brainstem and cervical spinal cord. The RT-PCR analysis of the postmortem brain, brainstem, liver, pancreas, plasma and CSF samples revealed the presence of HCV genome in all specimens except CSF. Clinical features, postmortem histopathology and PCR results and the possible etiopathogenesis of PEWR are briefly discussed.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome is a rare disorder of the central nervous system characterized by progressive rigidity and painful episodic spasms which are most prominently affecting paravertebral muscles and legs. According to past knowledge there are two variants of this syndrome. In most cases it is presented as autoimmune variant with positive antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). Paraneoplastic variant is very rare and is connected with antiamphiphysin antibodies. Concurrence of both antibodies is unlikely. A patient with paraneoplastic stiff person syndrome is presented. At the beginning of the disease positive antiamphiphysin antibodies were detected. Anti-GAD antibodies were negative. Long-term and extensive diagnostic work-up revealed carcinoma of the left breast with metastases to axillary lymph nodes. Mastectomy with evacuation of axillary lymph nodes was performed, followed by chemotherapy.

AB  - A 50 year old woman developed progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity over a three year period. Her CSF contained oligoclonal bands and both her serum and CSF contained antibodies directed against GABA-ergic synapses (anti-glutamic acid dehydrogenase antibodies). These antibodies have recently been described in cases of stiff man syndrome. Both disorders may be part of a clinical spectrum that has an underlying autoimmune basis.

AB  - A 59-year-old woman with a past history of pigmentary retinopathy developed progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity (PEWR) characterized clinically by cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal signs and stiffness with painful muscle spasms. At the same period, retinopathy strikingly worsened, Her serum contained antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). She developed diabetes mellitus under corticotherapy, which was inefficient. Neurologic signs dramatically improved with diazepam and high dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (i.v. Ig). Anti-GAD antibodies have been described in stiff man syndrome, but in only one previous case of PEWR. Presence of such autoantibodies in serum and improvement following i,v. IgG infusion strongly suggest an autoimmune mechanism involving, in our case central nervous system, pancreas and probably retina.

AB  - Background/Objective: The most prominent clinical features of progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity (PER) are painful spasms and rigidity accompanied by clinical signs of brainstem and spinal cord involvement. In initial reports, PER had fatal outcome. Later, clinical improvement related to corticosteroid therapy has been described in some cases. The objective of this study was to signify a reputed clinical significance of corticosteroid therapy in PER. Methods: Case report. Results: A 50-year-old man developed progressive syndrome of tonic extensor spasms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed areas of signal changes in cervical spinal cord and lower brainstem, whereas cerebrospinal fluid analysis indicated subacute encephalomyelitis. His condition dramatically improved on oral corticosteroid therapy. Clinical improvement was accompanied by normalization of MRI findings. Conclusion: For this patient with PER, corticosteroid therapy was a dramatically effective and life-saving treatment, although initiated rather late in the course of the disease.

AB  - Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune disorder associated with antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-Ab), the key enzyme in gamma-aminobutyric acid synthesis (GABA). In order to investigate the role of cerebral benzodiazepine-receptor binding in SPS, we performed [C-11]flumazenil (FMZ) positron emission tomography (PET) in a female patient with SPS compared to nine healthy controls. FMZ is a radioligand to the postsynaptic central benzodiazepine receptor which is co-localized with the GABA-A receptor. In the SPS patient, we found a global reduction of cortical FMZ binding. In addition, distinct local clusters of reduced radiotracer binding were observed. These data provide first in vivo evidence for a reduced postsynaptic GABA-A receptor availability which may reflect the loss of GABAergic neuronal inhibition in SPS.

AU  - Dalakas, M. C.
PY  - 2005
PD  - Dec
AB  - Controlled trials with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) were conducted in patients with tiff erson Syndrome (SPS) and dermatomyositis (DM), two humoraly mediated neurological disorders, and in inclusion body myositis (IBM), a T-cell-mediated inflammatory myopathy. The clinical efficacy was compared with alterations on tissue expression of complement, cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and immunoregulatory genes. The following patients were randomized in three separate trials to receive IVIg or placebo A for 3 mo: (a) 16 patients with anti-GAD antibody-positive SPS; (b) 15 patients with DM resistant to therapies; and (c) 19 patients with IBM. After a washout, they crossed to the alternative therapy for another 3 mo. Efficacy was based on the difference in the respective disease scores from baseline to the second and third month of the infusions. In patients with SPS and DM, the scores changed positively and significantly from months 1 through 3, but returned to baseline when the patients crossed to placebo. In contrast, the scores in the placebo-randomized group remained constant or worsened from months I to 3, but improved significantly after crossing to IVIg. The, muscle scores of patients with IBM did not significantly change between IVIg or placebo. In SPS, the anti-GAD(65) antibody titers declined after IVIg but not after placebo. In DM, there was reduction of complement consumption, interception of membranolytic attack complex formation, downregulation of inflammation, fibrosis, cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules, and alterations in thousands of immunoregulatory genes. We conclude that IVIg is a safe and effective therapy for patients with SPS and DM unresponsive to other agents. In tissues, IVIg restores tissue cytoarchitecture by suppressing the inflammatory mediators at the protein, mRNA, and gene level.

TI  - The role of IVIg in the treatment of patients with stiff person syndrome and other neurological diseases associated with anti-GAD antibodies
AU  - Dalakas, M. C.
PY  - 2005
PD  - May
AB  - Introduction High-titre anti-GAD antibodies are characteristically seen in patients with stiff person syndrome (SPS). Other CNS disorders, rarely associated with high anti-GAD antibody titres, include: a) SPS-plus, a syndrome characterised by SPS and cerebellar ataxia; b) Batten's disease; and c) rare patients with epilepsy and idiopathic cerebellar ataxia. Currently, high-titre anti-GAD antibodies serve only as markers of an autoimmune process within the CNS because their pathogenic role in the afore-mentioned disorders has not been established. In SPS, there is evidence of autoimmune pathogenesis based on: the association of the disease with other autoimmune disorders or autoantibodies; immunogenetic background; presence of oligoclonal IgG bands in the CSF with increased intrathecal anti-GAD antibody synthesis and response to immunotherapies. SPS is the only GAD-positive CNS disease where a controlled study with immunotherapy has been conducted. Methods Sixteen anti-GAD antibody-positive patients were randomised to receive IVIg or placebo for 3 months. After a washout, they crossed to the alternative therapy for another three months. Efficacy was based on the difference in scores of the distribution of stiffness index and heightened sensitivity (spasms) from baseline to the second and third month of the infusions. Direct treatment and carry-over effect were compared for both groups. Results The stiffness scores in the IVIg-randomised patients declined significantly from month 1 through 4, but rebounded when they crossed to placebo. In contrast, the scores in the placebo-randomised group remained constant from month 1-4 but dropped significantly after crossing to IVIg. Eleven patients who received IVIg became able to walk unassisted, stopped falling and assumed household or work duties. The duration of benefit varied from 6-12 weeks or up to a year. The antiGAD(65) antibody titres declined after IVIg, but not after placebo. Conclusion Based on a controlled study, IVIg is a safe and effective therapy for SPS in patients unresponsive to other agents. Whether IVIg has a role in the other GAD-positive patients with neurological disease, or in SPS patients without GAD antibodies, remains unknown.

AB  - Over the last years the clinical picture of autoimmune encephalitis has gained importance in neurology. The broad field of symptoms and syndromes poses a great challenge in diagnosis for clinicians. Early diagnosis and the initiation of the appropriate treatment is the most relevant step in the management of the patients. Over the last years advances in neuroimmunology have elucidated pathophysiological basis and improved treatment concepts. In this monocentric study we compare demographics, diagnostics, treatment options and outcomes with knowledge from literature. We present 38 patients suffering from autoimmune encephalitis. Antibodies were detected against NMDAR and LGI1 in seven patients, against GAD in 6 patients) one patient had coexisting antibodies against GABA(A) and GABA(B)), against CASPR2, IGLON5, YO, Glycine in 3 patients, against Ma-2 in 2 patients, against CV2 and AMPAR in 1 patient; two patients were diagnosed with hashimoto encephalitis with antibodies against TPO/TG. First, we compare baseline data of patients who were consecutively diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis from a retrospective view. Further, we discuss when to stop immunosuppressive therapy since how long treatment should be performed after clinical stabilization or an acute relapse is still a matter of debate. Our experiences are comparable with data from literature. However, in contrary to other experts in the field we stop treatment and monitor patients very closely after tumor removal and after rehabilitation from first attack.

AB  - Stiff-Person syndrome (SPS) is a rare and disabling disorder characterized by continuous motor unit activity causing severe rigidity and episodic spasms in axial and limb muscles. It deteriorates the quality of life and causes a serious burden in the patient's life. It is frequently associated with other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes mellitus. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin, anti-anxiety drugs, muscle relaxants, anti-convulsants will improve symptoms, but will not cure the disorder. Therapeutic plasma exchange is an alternative treatment for the patients resistant to other treatment options. Here, we report a patient with SPS treated in intensive care unit and underwent therapeutic plasma exchange.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare, debilitating condition which presents with progressive and inconsistent neurological features. The main symptoms are stiffness and intermittent, painful muscle spasms, triggered and exacerbated by stressful and emotional stimuli. The fluctuating clinical nature of SPS, and otherwise normal neurological examination, often lead to a misdiagnosis of conversion disorder. Psychiatric symptoms frequently accompany this disorder and patients are often first seen by psychiatrists. SPS is autoimmune-based: antibodies are directed against glutamate decarboxylase, resulting in dysregulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain which is considered the cause of the neuropsychiatric symptomatology. SPS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of conversion disorder. Effective management requires early detection, a collaborative approach with GABA-ergic medication and intravenous immunoglobulins, and management of concomitant psychiatric disorders. We describe a patient with SPS. Only one other case has been reported in South Africa.

AB  - Stiff-man syndrome (SMS) is a rare disorder of the central nervous system of probable autoimmune origin. Patients with SMS often have other autoimmune diseases, in particular type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Approximately 60% of patients with SMS have high titers of autoantibodies against the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase, Similar to SMS, the majority of patients with IDDM have autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase at or before diabetes onset, although usually at a lower titer and with a different reaction pattern than patients with SMS. To investigate the immunogenetic basis of SMS, we HLA-typed 18 patients with the disease. Seventy-two percent carried the DQB1*0201 allele (13 of 18, P = 0.02 vs. 18 of 48 controls), indicating that SMS is associated with this allele. DQB1*0201 is also a susceptibility allele for IDDM and other autoimmune diseases. Patients with SMS carried the IDDM-protective DQB1*0602 allele and other sequence-related DQB1*06 alleles with the same frequency observed in controls. In contrast, these alleles are rarely found in IDDM. Five of 8 (62.5%) SMS patients lacking a DQB1*06 allele were diabetic in contrast to only 2 of 10 (20%) with a DQB1*06 allele (P = 0.08), suggesting that the presence of DQB1*0602 or other DQB1*06 alleles may be associated with a reduced prevalence of diabetes among patients with SMS.

AB  - Background: Little information is available about the incidence of stiff-man syndrome (SMS) (the classic form or its variants) or about long-term treatment responses and outcomes. Objective: To comprehensively describe the characteristics of a cohort of patients with SMS. Design: Observational study. Setting: Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. Patients: Ninety-nine patients with classic SMS vs variants of the disorder, both glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 kD isoform (GAD65) antibody seropositive and seronegative. Main Outcome Measures: Neurological, autoimmune, serological, and oncological findings; treatments; and outcomes between January 1984 and December 2008. Results: The median follow-up duration was 5 years (range, 0-23 years). Seventy-nine patients (59 having classic SMS, 19 having partial SMS, and 1 having progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus [PERM]) were GAD65 antibody seropositive. Sixty-seven percent (53 of 79) of them had at least 1 coexisting autoimmune disease, and 4% (3 of 79) had cancer. GAD65 antibody values at initial evaluation were significantly higher among patients with classic SMS (median value, 623 nmol/L) than among patients with partial SMS (median value, 163 nmol/L) (P <.001). The initial GAD65 antibody value was positively correlated with the last follow-up Rankin score (P=.03). Among 20 patients who were GAD65 antibody seronegative (6 with classic SMS, 12 with partial SMS, and 2 with PERM), 15% (3 of 20) had at least 1 coexisting autoimmune disease, and 25% (5 of 20) had cancer (3 with amphiphysin autoimmunity and breast carcinoma and 2 with Hodgkin lymphoma). Excluding patients with PERM, all patients but 1 had sustained improvements with at least 1 gamma-aminobutyric acid agent, usually diazepam; the median dosage for patients with classic SMS was 40.0 mg/d. Additional improvements occurred among 14 of 34 patients (41%) who received immunotherapy (intravenous immune globulin, azathioprine, prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, or cyclophosphamide). Sixteen of 25 patients (64%) with extended follow-up duration remained ambulatory. Conclusions: Recognition of classic SMS vs variants is important because appropriate therapy improves symptoms in most patients. Classification by anatomical extent and by GAD65 antibody serostatus gives important diagnostic and prognostic information.

AB  - Case Summary A 30-year-old healthy man presents after a fall with diffuse weakness and pain and recent onset left eye ptosis in the setting of three weeks of progressive bilateral leg weakness, gait instability, and difficulty washing his hair due to upper extremity weakness. He had also developed stiffness in his neck and shoulders and uncontrollable muscle spasms. Exam was notable for ptosis, fatiguing weakness in extremities, increased tone, hyperreflexia with clonus, and spastic gait. A mediastinal mass was found on chest CT (Fig. 1), and biopsy confirmed an invasive thymoma with positive nodes. Serum testing was positive for antibodies to acetylcholine receptors as well as glutamic acid decarboxylase.

AB  - We report on two patients with truncal rigidity and agoraphobia. The fear of crossing open places had been judged as psychogenic in both cases. The detection of positive GAD-antibodies led to our final diagnosis. Treatment with liquorphoresis and clonazepam or diazepam alone resulted in a prompt amelioration of the rigidity and, to a lesser extent, of the agoraphobia as well. The stiff-man syndrome has neurological and psychological aspects and shows one more facet of the syndrome of agoraphobia first described by Westphal.

TI  - Role of EMG evaluation in muscle hyperactivity syndromes
AU  - Valls-Sole, J.
AU  - Montero, J.
PY  - 2004
PD  - Mar
AB  - Muscle hyperactivity can be a clinical feature on its own or, more commonly, an observation on electromyography (EMG) examinations. Whatever manifestation it takes, muscle hyperactivity always means enhanced excitability of muscle, axons or neurons. Clinical findings may be variable, ranging from fasciculations to muscle cramps. Even though clinical examination may lead in most instances to suggest the diagnosis of the underlying disease, EMG studies are necessary to identify the type of abnormal discharges and suggest the site of their suspected origin. Although in clinical studies, the action potential showing abnormal muscle hyperactivity is practically always recorded from muscle fibers, the site in which the impulse has arisen will determine its shape and firing patterns. In this review, we describe the EMG characteristics observed in syndromes featuring muscle hyperactivity and the pathophysiology underlying the abnormal firing of muscle fibers.

AB  - Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) is a major autoantigen in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). This was initially identified as a 64-65 kD molecule according to migration in gels after immunoprecipitation from pancreatic islets. We studied the antigenicity of two different radiolabelled preparations of GAD, derived either by affinity purification from porcine brain and known to contain GAD 65 and GAD 67, or by expression from a cDNA for human GAD 65 by rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL). Radiolabelled immunoprecipitated pellets from the reaction of potent antisera to GAD from patients with IDDM were examined by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE under reducing or non-reducing conditions. Also, preparations of porcine brain GAD were 'depleted' of GAD by exposure to antisera, and then similarly re-examined. Autoradiography of radiolabelled GAD either affinity purified from porcine brain, or expressed by RRL, showed that the immunoprecipitated protein migrated under non-reducing conditions according to a M(r) of similar to 110-130 kD, corresponding to dimeric forms of monomeric GAD of similar to 55-65 kD. Depletion by immunoprecipitation of this minor higher M(r) component from preparations of GAD left, in the supernatant, an abundance of GAD of M(r) 64-65 kD corresponding to monomer that was completely non-reactive with potent IDDM sera. We conclude that IDDM sera react with the GAD molecule in a dimeric (or oligomeric) form. Our findings have general connotations for self-tolerance and autoimmunity.

AB  - Cancer can affect the peripheral nervous system by non-metastatic, sometimes immune-mediated mechanisms. Recognition of these paraneoplastic syndromes is important because it can lead to the detection of the tumor, and also helps to avoid unnecessary studies to determine the cause of the neurologic symptoms in patients with cancer. Many paraneoplastic syndromes of the peripheral nervous system are not associated with serum antibodies that serve as markers of paraneoplasia. For this group of disorders the diagnosis depends on the clinician's index of suspicion and conventional electrophysiologic and laboratory tests. Treatment of the tumor, immunotherapy, or both may improve some of these syndromes. This review focuses on paraneoplastic syndromes of the spinal cord, peripheral nerve, and muscle, (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Muscle stiffness in stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is produced by continuous, involuntary firing of motor units that is thought to be caused by an autoimmune mediated dysfunction of GABA-ergic inhibitory neurones. We have postulated that the loss of GABA-ergic inputs from spinal interneurones alone is insufficient to produce tonic firing of motor neurones and that excessive supraspinal excitation could also play a role. To determine whether SPS is associated with dysfunction in supraspinal GABA-ergic neurones, we assessed the excitability of the motor cortex with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in seven SPS: patients and seven age-matched healthy volunteers, SPS patients had normal central motor conduction times, normal thresholds for motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in leg muscles, and a normal MEP stimulus versus response recruitment curve with increasing TMS intensities in resting hand and leg muscles. Cortical silent periods were shortened in leg muscles. Intracortical inhibition and excitation were assessed while recording from the abductor pollicis brevis, using a paired pulse TMS paradigm with subthreshold conditioning stimuli, Patients had decreased inhibition and markedly increased facilitation at short intervals. Using paired suprathreshold TMS, patients exhibited increased facilitation at 20- and 40-ms intervals. These results point to a hyperexcitability of the motor cortex in SPS, which could be explained by impairment of supraspinal GABA-ergic neurones, leading to an impaired balance between inhibitory and excitatory intracortical circuitry.

AB  - Background and aims: Glycine receptor (GlycR) antibodies are most frequently associated with the syndrome progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus. Previous reports of GlycR-associated syndromes demonstrated a variable response to immunotherapy. Neuropathological reports are few. The current case is of interest in that it was characterised predominantly by brainstem features without rigidity, responded to immunotherapy and proceeded to post-mortem examination. Method(s): A well 64-year-old man presented with external ophthalmoplegia, facial weakness, bulbar dysfunction, hyper-reflexia and myoclonus with onset three days after coryzal symptoms. There was no rigidity, cognitive impairment or seizures. No neoplastic or vasculitic condition was identified. Serum GlycR antibodies were positive. Negative tests included: onconeuronal antibodies; antibodies vs. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, voltage gated potassium channel, glutamic acid decarboxylase, and gangliosides; MRI of the neural axis; cerebrospinal fluid analysis; nerve conduction studies. Result(s): Despite two courses of intravenous immunoglobulin, he had a respiratory arrest and required prolonged invasive ventilation, complicated by fluctuating tachy-bradycardia with intermittent asystole. Following plasma exchange and corticosteroids, he was weaned from ventilation and began mobilising. Ophthalmoplegia and myoclonus completely resolved but bulbar recovery was incomplete. The patient died following severe pulmonary oedema 110 days after presentation. Detailed post-mortem examinations found no significant abnormalities in the brain, spinal cord or heart and no evidence of a malignancy. Conclusion(s): This case illustrates a GlycR-associated brainstem syndrome with significant autonomic involvement as well as the potential for neurological improvement with immunotherapy. The absence of rigidity was unusual.1 The lack of histopathological change supports previous literature arguing against a destructive pathogenesis of GlycR-associated syndromes.1.

AB  - Three patients with a clinical diagnosis of stiff-man syndrome were studied with simultaneous video-electroencephalographic-surface electromyographic recordings in addition to routine electromyography in order to obtain objective data to confirm their diagnosis, to improve our understanding of the diagnosis of stiff-man syndrome, and to define reproducible clinical and neurophysiologic criteria for the stiff-man syndrome. These patients had the following features of this syndrome: (1) continuous muscle activity that varied with awake and sleep states, posture, passive and active movements, and medications; (2) superimposed intermittent generalized contractions while awake, which continued into drowsiness and interfered with onset of sleep; and (3) abnormal cocontractions of antagonistic muscles. The characteristic findings in the stiff-man syndrome can be recorded by using video-electroencephalographic-surface electromyographic techniques, a useful application of equipment already available in most electroencephalography laboratories. Neurophysiologic techniques can help in elucidating the clinical findings in the stiff-man syndrome. Further systematic study in patients before and during treatment is needed to identify common diagnostic criteria for this syndrome.Copyright © 1990 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research

AB  - Objective: We aimed to analyze clinical and immunologic features of a cohort of stiff-person spectrum disorder (SPSD) patients, who have been clinically managed by us in recent years. Background(s): To date, the largest cohort of SPSD patients was analyzed in a work by Martinez-Hernandez et al. (2016) and included121 subjects. In Russia, only single case reports have been published. We present a relatively large cohort of 20 patients with SPSD. Method(s): A retrospective analysis of health records of 20 patients diagnosed by our group with SPSD during the period of 2015-2019 was performed. Patients have been followed at the Research Center of Neurology (Moscow), Buyanov Moscow City Clinical Hospital, and City General Hospital No. 2 (St. Petersburg). All available demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were extracted from the health records together with the results of EMG and neuroimaging studies. Result(s): Out of 20 patients only 2 were men. The median age-at-onset was 50 years ranging from 22 to 69. The median of the time from the first symptom onset to the correct diagnosis was 29 months (14.25; 64). Nobody was referred with an initially diagnosed or suspected SPSD. The most frequent diagnostic 'masks' were 'degenerative spine disease' and 'somatoform disorder'. In most cases, stiffness distribution was quite typical. Most common first complaints included stiffness in lumbar region and thighs as well as painful muscle spasms. Eighteen patients were found to have serum antibodies to GAD65, 2 were negative for serum antibodies to both GAD65 and amphiphysin, of whom 1 was positive for CSF anti- GAD65. Five patients were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Six patients had cerebellar signs, 13 experienced falls, and 2 had epileptic seizures. In 6 subjects, symptomatic therapy only was enough to sufficiently improve clinical status, whereas other demanded immunotherapy. Conclusion(s): The demographic data were consistent with that published on SPSD. The time from the first symptom onset to the conclusive diagnosis was similar to, and even slightly shorter than, that in the study by Rakocevic et al. (2019). Causes of diagnostic pitfalls in SPSD may include (1) insufficient awareness among medical specialists and (2) misinterpretations by the physicians of the unusual or non-specific complaints at the disease onset. Clinical and EMG features are of great importance given that occasional SPSD cases may be antibody-negative.

The immune response to an isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), GAD65, is associated with two clinically distinct diseases, stiff-man syndrome (SMS) and type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. We sought to identify differences in the cellular and humoral immune responses to GAD in these two diseases. Methods. We compared T-cell responses in 14 SMS patients with axial disease and 17 patients with type 1 diabetes. Findings. Peripheral blood T cells of eight SMS patients recognised different immunodominant epitopes of GAD65 compared with T cells from 17 patients with type 1 diabetes. GAD regions 81-171 and 313-403 induced a dominant T-cell response in six of eight patients with SMS but in only one of 17 patients with type 1 diabetes (p = 0.001). No SMS patients responded dominantly to GAD fragments 161-243 and 473-555 compared with ten patients with type 1 diabetes (p = 0.008). GAD antibodies were detected in 11 of 14 SMS patients (seven with diabetes) and 11 of 17 patients with type 1 diabetes; IgG1 was dominant in both groups. SMS patients, however, were more likely than patients with diabetes to have isotypes other than IgG1 (p = 0.03), in particular, IgG4 or IgE isotypes, which were not detected in patients with type 1 diabetes (p = 0.012). Interpretation. Our findings indicate differences between patients with SMS and type 1 diabetes in cellular (epitope recognition) and humoral (isotype pattern) responses to GAD65. Thus the same autoantigen can elicit distinct immune responses in patients with SMS, even when associated with diabetes, compared with patients with type 1 diabetes.

AB  - Objective: To study clinicopathological parameters in a 3-generation family with high-titer antiglutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies. Background(s): High-titer anti-GAD autoantibodies are a hallmark of neurological syndromes including Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) and autoimmune epilepsy. Low-GAD titers are typically seen in type 1 Diabetes (DM1). Design/Methods: Sera from three family members (female index patient, her father and her paternal grandmother) were serially tested for anti-GAD antibodies using ELISA, Western Blot (WB) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) on mouse brain and primary hippocampal neurons. Patients were examined and their medical histories assessed. Result(s): All patients had high-titer anti-GAD antibodies (>20,000 IU/ml-ELISA). The index patient, a 25-year-old woman, presented in 2012 with autoimmune epilepsy treated successfully with steroids and low-doses levetiracetam. Her serum immunoreacted strongly to cultured hippocampal neurons and brain cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus and striatum. By 2017, she developed typical SPS, without DM1. Her anti-GAD titers remained persistently high (2,5-4,6 x 106IU/ml) but the immunostaining intensity to hippocampal neurons, cerebellum and striatum diminished. Her father and grandmother have DM1 with very high-GAD titers (1,8 x 106 and 0,7 x 106 IU/ml respectively), never observed in DM1 patients alone without neurological manifestations, up to a-5-year follow-up. Their sera did not immunostain hippocampal neurons but bound to cerebellum, similarly to the index case. Preliminary WB data on brain extracts showed the same immunoreactivity pattern, presumably recognizing linear epitopes, in all 3 patients. Conclusion(s): This is the first family with very high anti-GAD titers in 3 generations. Whereas the index patient presented with autoimmune epilepsy that evolved into SPS without DM1, her family members had only DM1 and very high anti-GAD antibodies without neurological disease, even though their serum recognized neuronal epitopes similar to the index case. Whether patients with very high-GAD titers can develop neurological disease over a longer observational period, remains to be determined.

AB  - INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND: Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a neuroimmunological disorder characterized by progressive rigidity and painful muscle spasms. SPS is associated with autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). Generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder have been described in patients with SPS. CASE REPORT: A 56-year-old woman presented in 2013 with anxiety and memory concerns. She reported 1 year of worsening severe anxiety, depressed mood, poor concentration, inability to multitask, confusion, and insomnia. It affected her job as an administrative assistant, and friends and family had commented on her being overly worried, which was out of character. Neurological examination at the time was normal except for mild axial stiffness. She was prescribed escitalopram 10 mg daily which greatly improved her anxiety. A GAD65 antibody test result was 2689 nmol/L (reference <=0.02 nmol/L) on the Mayo paraneoplastic autoantibody panel. Over the next few years of evaluations, she developed worsening stiffness and gait imbalance requiring the use of a cane, and neurological examination revealed worsening axial rigidity, an unsteady broad-based gait, and saccadic pursuits with end-gaze nystagmus. Brain MRI revealed mild cerebellar atrophy. She then developed painful full body spasms. IVIg was started and maintained at 1 g/month, and benzodiazepines were increased to standing and as-needed doses with improvement of symptoms. SUMMARY/CONCLUSION: We describe a patient with GAD65 antibody-positive SPS with cerebellar ataxia whose presenting symptom was new-onset anxiety. There are cases of SPS being misdiagnosed as psychiatric or functional illness. It's important to consider this diagnosis in patients presenting with new-onset depression and anxiety.

AB  - Background: Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) results from an imbalance between excitatory aminergic and inhibitory GABAergic and glycinergic systems, and can be paraneoplastic. Method(s): We describe a case series of two patients presenting with trismus, who were initially treated for tetanus. Both subsequently developed long tract findings, neuropathic pain, lower extremity stiffness and myoclonus. One patient had known bladder cancer at the time of presentation, and the second was subsequently diagnosed with small cell lung cancer. Serologic testing revealed antibodies against glycine receptors in both. Other paraneoplastic antibodies were negative. Both responded to immunomodulatory treatment (IvIg and rituximab), in combination with treatment of their underlying cancers. Result(s): Literature review found three similar cases of Stiff Person Plus Syndrome with Progressive Encephalomyelitis with Rigidity and Myoclonus (PREM) with associated positive antibodies against glycine receptors. Glycinergic cells are important inhibitory cells at the spinal level. Glycinergic cells are also a target of the tetanus toxin. Conclusion(s): Anti Glycine may be an important antibody associated with Stiff Person Plus variant of Progressive Encephalomyelitis with Rigidity and Myoclonus (PREM). Paraneoplastic SPS should be considered in patients presenting with trismus.

AB  - Introduction: Limb and trunc rigidity, muscle spasms, brainstem signs and hyperekplexia characterize a disorder called PERM (Progressive Encephalomyelitis with Rigidity and Myoclonus) that was described in the spectrum of stiff-man syndrome, with positivity for anti-GAD antibodies, or as a paraneoplastic syndrome,with anti-amphiphysine antibodies. In hereditary hyperekplexya, mutations in the gene for glycine receptor were identified; receptors, located in the brain stem and in the spinal cord, mediate the inibitory control,which is impaired in hyperekplexia. Clinical summary: A 60-y old man,with a history of diffuse vasculopathy and bladder cancer, was admitted in January 2009 for progressive left leg rigidity with muscle spasms.He showed increased reflexes, disphagia, dysarthria,nocturnal dyspnea with laryngospasm, trismus and nystagmus.Tapping his forehead evoked massive startle reflex and muscle spasms.His symptoms improved slightly with clonazepam and carbamazepine.The EMG activity of the SCM, massereteris, deltoides and vastus medialis was suggestive for myclonus reticularis reflex. Tetanic antitoxin,paraneoplastic,rheumatologic and occult neoplasm screening were negative,as were serum anti-Hu, Yo, amphyphisine, Ri, Ma2, CRMP5/Cv2, recoverine, Ma1, GAD and VGKC antibodies. MRI of brain and spinal cord was normal.CSF examination showed a pleyocytosis. Anti-GlyR antibodies(courtesy of A. Vincent, Oxford)tested positive. Steroids and immunoglobulins was admistered, without significan improvement to the point of ICU admission, with intubation.After further steroid and immunoglobulin therapy, a progressive improvement was observed and he was readmitted to our ward. Episodes of delirium with delusions and agitation were observed, that responded to neuroleptic treatment. Remaining spasms slowly abated. After three months he was discharged on valproate, clonazepam, baclofen, olanzapine. Monthly immunoglobulin cycles are still being carried on. At 5-month follow up the patient is alert, well oriented, without significant muscle spasms, bulbar signs or startle response. Due to a right femur fracture, which occurred during hospitalisation, he is still wheelchair bound, but able to stand. Conclusion(s): When confronted with stiff person "plus" disorders, a suspicion of PERM should arise and a search for antibodies against glycine receptor performed. Compared with other PERM etiologies, anti-GlyR antibodies associated PERM seems to have a better prognosis.

AB  - Purpose: Stiff person syndrome (SPS) characterized by progresive, severe rigidity or stiffness most prominently the spine and lower extremities is an autimmune disorder. The study was planned to research spine and lower extremity problems and investigate the effects of physiotherapy in SPS patients. Material(s) and Method(s): 11 SPS patients (age: 40+/-5.53, 5 women and 6 men) hospitalized in the neurology department of Hacettepe University participated in the study. Head and body movements, shortness of lower limb muscles (quadriceps, hamstring and adductor) and thoracic mobility of patients were measured in centimeters. Results were compared with values of age- and sex-matched 11 healthy subjects. In addition, gait and balance were evaluated with Timed Up and Go test (TUG) and daily living activities with the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). The individualized physiotherapy program included the body and joint mobilization, relaxation, breathing and stretching exercises was applied to patients during hospitalization. Result(s): All values of patients were lower values than in healthy individuals all the measurements in centimeters before treatment and at discharge (p<0.05). Hospitalization was 19+/-3.80 days. Thoracic mobility, trunk lateral flexion, head and trunk flexion increased (p<0.05) at discharge. Shortness of quadriceps and hamstrings was decreased (p<0.05). TUG score decreased from 26.72+/-2.73 s to 24.72+/-2.48 s (p=0.02). FIM score was accured from 113.27+/-20.20 to 115.18+/-17.36. While this increase was not statistically significant (p=0.68), the increase in locomation subgroup was significant (p<0.05). Conclusion(s): The physiotherapy program included mobilization, stretching, relaxation and breathing exercises affects positively locomation, daily life and thus the quality of life in SPS patients.

AB  - Introduction: Stiff Person Syndrome is a rare and disabling central nervous system disorder, probably under-diagnosed, characterized by muscle stiffness and episodic spasms that involve axial and limb musculature. It is associated with high titers of antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) and frequently with autoimmune disorders. Rigidity and spasms are symptomatically treated with benzodiazepines, baclofen, tiagabine and levetiracetam. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin is well-tolerated and effective. Other therapies such as plasmapheresis and rituximab have been tried, with good responses. Objective(s): To present the 4-year follow-up of a 62-year-old patient clinically and electrophysiologically diagnosed with stiff person syndrome with a good response to IV immunoglobulin treatment. Method(s): IV immunoglobulin was administered once a month during the first two years, and every three-four months in the next two years. He became asymptomatic six months after the beginning of the treatment. The patient was recorded on video before and after the treatment, showing the clinical improvement. Blink reflex and EMG studies were carried out in agonist and antagonist muscles, in supine and bipedestation positions. Result(s): The first two EMG studies showed continuous muscular activity and spasms in abdominal and back muscles. The next study showed an improvement, with no involuntary muscular activity. An EMG per year has been performed for the last two years and the results were within normal limits. Conclusion(s): Our patient had a very good response to IV immunoglobulin treatment. Four years after the diagnosis he remains asymptomatic, with normal EMG studies.

AB  - Purpose: Anti-GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase) antibodies are associated with refractory partial seizures and stiff person syndrome (SPS). We examined the clinical features and outcome of patients with anti- GAD antibodies and seizures. Method(s): Four patients had anti-GAD antibodies and seizures. Seizure type, clinical features, comorbidity, anti-GAD titer, other autoimmune antibodies, MRI, EMG, EEG, treatment methods and outcomes were evaluated. Result(s): All patients were female, had complex partial seizures (CPS) with an average frequency of 4x/month beginning between ages 26-42. One patient with hyperthyroidism and newly diagnosed diabetes (DM) complained of oscillopsia and gait instability. One patient with hypothyroidism and newly diagnosed insulin dependentDMhad truncal stiffness; EMG showed SPS. The other two had no comorbidities. The serum anti-GAD titers ranged from 30 to 236 U/ml. Three patients had elevated thyroperoxidase or thyroglobulin antibody. Malignancy workup was unrevealing. EEG findings were consistent with temporal lobe seizures. MRI revealed mesial temporal sclerosis in two patients and increased hippocampal signal in a third patient. The patient with oscillopsia failed two anticonvulsants and was seizure- free after IVIG therapy. The patient with SPS failed four anticonvulsants but became seizure-free after steroid treatment for 6 weeks. The third patient who failed six anticonvulsants became seizure-free on lacosamide. The fourth did not respond to immunotherapy and had surgical resection with moderate benefit. Conclusion(s): Immunotherapy successfully treats seizures in some patients with anti-GAD antibody syndrome. Patients with the antibody should be evaluated for endocrine disorders and SPS if they complain of stiffness.

AB  - Patients or Programs: A 39-year-old woman with worsening spasticity after laminectomy. Program Description: The patient had a history of insulindependent diabetes mellitus and progressive low back pain with increased tone in lower extremities for 3 years. Spine imaging (computed tomography, serial magnetic resonance imaging) revealed L5-S1 mild disk herniation with mild foraminal narrowing. The patient underwent a L5-S1 laminectomy, and, after surgery, her spasticity and neuropathic pain in the lower extremities increased. Anti-GAD75 antibody titer was elevated (77.6, n<1.5), and simultaneous firing of agonist-antagonist muscles of lower extremities in electromyography confirmed the diagnosis of stiff person syndrome. The patient received intravenous immunoglobulin over 5 days and oral baclofen. She was transferred to acute inpatient rehabilitation with lower extremity pain, increased tone, and flexion contracture at the hips with difficult ambulation. Setting(s): Acute inpatient rehabilitation hospital. Result(s): After 2 weeks of acute inpatient rehabilitation, which included daily repetitive passive range of motion, stretching, moist heat, hydrotherapy, and use of a stretcher chair, the patient's axial and limb stiffness and functional mobility improved. She was able to ambulate with a rolling walker from 20-150 ft and stair climbing improved. Discussion(s): Stiff person syndrome is a rare neurologic condition characterized by symptoms of muscle stiffness and spasms usually starting axially. The involuntary contractions of agonist and antagonist muscles caused by motor unit activity are the key clinical and electrophysiological markers. Anti-GAD75 antibodies are positive in 65% of cases and are associated with other autoimmune conditions. The chronic, progressive, and variable nature of the disease indicates the need for life-long management and an individualized rehabilitation program. Conclusion(s): Awareness of this rare condition in addition to a comprehensive history and physical examination could avoid unnecessary invasive procedures. This case illustrates that intensive rehabilitation with physical therapy and occupational therapy can improve the functional outcome and quality of life of individuals with stiff person syndrome.

AB  - Patients or Programs: A 59-year-old woman with a 10-year history of stiff person syndrome (SPS). Program Description: The patient presented to an inpatient rehabilitation facility with pain, tremors, spasticity, stiffness, and jerking and/or myoclonic movements that hindered ambulation. She had greater left lower extremity spasticity when compared with the right. Hence, she was started on a comprehensive, multidisciplinary movement disorder rehabilitation program. Setting(s): Inpatient rehabilitation facility. Result(s): Patient's dystonic and myoclonic symptoms improved with levetiracetam. She was treated with diazepam and baclofen for spasticity management, without significant results. The patient was unable to tolerate physical activity secondary to worsening pain and spasticity. Tizanidine was implemented, which led to gradual spasticity reduction that allowed rehabilitation program reimplementation. As a result, the patient's lower extremity strength and range of motion improved significantly, which allowed her to ambulate with a walker upon discharge. Discussion(s): SPS is a rare neurologic disorder with features of an autoimmune disease characterized by muscle rigidity that waxes and wanes with concurrent spasms and a heightened sensitivity to stimuli such as noise, touch, and emotional distress, which can set off muscle spasms. Patients with SPS produce glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies that affect GABA-mediated inhibition from the central nervous system. If glutamic acid decarboxylase function is inhibited significantly, then GABA available for these functions is decreased, and muscles become continuously stimulated by motor neurons. Based on the described pathophysiology, baclofen and benzodiazepines are considered first-line pharmacologic treatment for SPS. We believe that physical activity without adequate spasticity management exacerbated the patient's symptoms, which makes rehabilitation efforts challenging. Fortunately, tizanidine provided adequate symptomatic relief that permitted physical and occupational therapy focused on range of motion preservation, strengthening, and voluntary movement control. Conclusion(s): The rehabilitation treatment program for individuals with SPS should begin with symptom reduction via education and pharmacotherapy. This should be followed by a carefully developed exercise program that improves overall function and quality of life.

AB  - Case Reports: Baclofen withdrawal is a serious and potentially life threatening condition. It can vary from mild symptoms of sleepiness, diaphoresis and fatigue to severe symptoms of high fevers, seizures rhabdomyolysis, altered mental status and multiorgan failure. We report a case of severe prolonged withdrawal from recurrent baclofen pump failure in a patient with Stiff- person syndrome (SPS). Case: 53 year old lady with a history of SPS was electively admitted for 5 days of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) therapy for her SPS. At baseline she has spasms and rigidity for which she is on a continuous infusion of baclofen via a pump. Her exam was significant for an increase in tone and a decrease in power in upper and lower extremities. On day 4 she had worsening mental status, witnessed seizure and fever to 104. She was transferred to the intensive care, intubated for airway protection and started on antibiotics after sending cultures. Over the next couple of days she continued to have fevers to 106 F despite broad spectrum antibiotics and cultures being negative. Her creatine kinase was elevated to 45,000 IU/L. There was no reason to suspect neuroleptic malignant syndrome or serotonin syndromes. She had a history of failure of the baclofen pump in the past with mild withdrawal. A nuclear medicine scan to evaluate the baclofen pump showed lack of dye spread and blockage of the catheter and pump. She was started on benzodiazepines and oral doses of baclofen and underwent a revision surgery. Her post operative recovery was uneventful but prolonged requiring high doses of intravenous baclofen. Discussion(s): Baclofen is an analog of the inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma amino butyric acid (GABA). It causes slow neuronal hyperpolarization and reduces the output of excitatory neurotransmitters.Abrupt withdrawal cause severe spasticity and central nervous system hyperexcitability in part because chronic intrathecal infusion downregulates GABA B-receptor sensitivity. Pump failure needs to be identified early in the course to avoid catastrophic outcomes. If baclofen withdrawal due to pump failure is suspected, oral baclofen and benzodiazepine therapy should be initiated.

AB  - We represent case report of stiff person syndrome (SPS) with eyes' movement disorders and cerebellar symptoms in patient with verified autoimmune thyroiditis and confirmed sarcoidosis of intrathoracic lymph nodes. The patient P., 50, suffers from significant strain, muscle stiffness, especially in the back, abdomen and pelvic girdle that complicated gait. Vertical ocular misalignment, limited abduction of the left eye, rotatory nystagmus. Hyperlordosis in lumbar spine. Significant bilateral brisk tendon reflexes. Finger-nose test cannot be performed because of stiffness. Intramuscular electromyography: Stormy activity of motor unit potentials with significant overtone at the background is registered. Glutamate decarboxylase antibodies = 196 U/l, immunoglobulin G = 16.68g/l. From 2004 the diagnosis of autoimmune thyroiditis confirmed by puncture biopsy. In 2005 the diagnosis of SPS was made out, and she received diazepam, clonazepam, baclofen, tizanidine, which gave no relief. In 2008 patient took a course of plasma exchange without apparent result, then course of immunoglobulins, which significantly worsening the condition. In 2009 - gasping without physical exercise, severe pain in the chest. X-ray, then pucture biopsy elicited sarcoidisis of intrathoracic lymph nodes. The course of steroid therapy was performed with good recovery. In 2010 botulinotherapy was performed and its effectiveness was high. After injections the patient marked substantially improvement: walks by herself. There are no data in medical literature showing SPS with systemic pathology of cell-immune answer, i.e. sarcoidosis. Botulinotherapy may be one of the variants of symptomatic treatment of patients with SPS that can raise the quality of life of such patients.

AB  - Introduction: Glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (Anti-GAD) associated neurological disorders includes Stiff-person syndrome, and its variants, such as stiff-trunk syndrome, stiff-limb syndrome, progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus and SPS-plus. Cerebellar ataxia and epilepsy are also associated to anti- GAD syndromes. Objective(s): To describe neurological disorders associated with anti- GAD in a Brazilian series of 12 patients. Patients and Methods: This Brazilian series includes 12 patients with neurological disorders associated with Anti-GAD (Laboratorysupported - RIA) or electromyographic (EMG) findings (continuous motor unit activity). Seven patients were females and five patients were males and mean age of diagnosis was 47.25 years. Result(s): This series includes 5 cases of stiff-limb syndrome (2 cases with stiff-lower limbs, 2 cases with stiff-one limb, one case with stiff-three-limbs), 4 cases of classical stiff-person syndrome and 3 cases of ataxia cerebellar associated with anti-GAD. Apart from one patient, all had positive serum serology for anti-GAD. All patients with stiff-person and stiff-limb syndrome had EMG confirmation. Diabetes mellitus (3), Hashimotto thyroiditis (4), and vitiligo (1) were observed in the present series. Epilepsy was found in 3 patients. Conclusion(s): In this Brazilian series of neurological syndromes associated with anti-GAD we found 5 cases of stiff-limb syndrome, 4 cases of classical stiff-person syndrome, and 3 cases of cerebellar ataxia. Epilepsy was associated in three patients.

AB  - Objective: To describe a clinical case of PERM ( Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus) caused by anti-glycine receptor antibodies. Background Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) is a rare disorder presenting subacutely with rigidity, muscle spasms, brainstem signs and hyperekplexia. Hyperekplexia results from disruption of the normal inhibitory glycinergic pathways concentrated in the caudal pons. We report a case of relapsing PERM secondary to anti-glycine receptor antibody. Design/Methods: A 65 year old man presented in 2001 with a two week history of severe hyperekplexia, rigidity of spine and lower limbs, bilateral ptosis, and horizontal gaze palsies. Investigations revealed CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis and simultaneous concentric needle EMG was consistent with a diagnosis of PERM. Anti-glycine receptor antibodies were identified when patient sera were tested for binding to human embryonic kidney cells transfected with EGFP-tagged glycine receptor alpha1 subunit. The patient's serum bound strongly to the GlyR-EGFP expressing cells. A diagnosis of anti-glycine receptor mediated PERM was made. The patient responded to initial intense immunosuppression and remained stable for many years with no further immunomodulation. Result(s): Ten years after initial presentation he presented again with a two month history of worsening ptosis, complex ophthalmoplegia, recurrent hyperekplexia, and limb rigidity. There was no evidence of intercurrent sepsis or underlying malignancy. High titres of anti-glycine receptor antibodies were again identified in serum and CSF. The recurrent symptoms improved quickly with immunomodulation. Conclusion(s): Relapsing PERM due to anti-glycine receptor antibodies ten years after initial presentation is a rare and interesting clinical scenario. Rather than a monophasic illness, the disease course has been relapsing and remitting requiring combined aggressive immunosuppressive treatment. This raises several interesting clinical issues including the use of serial antibody testing to predict clinical relapse and of long term, low-grade immunosuppression in relapse prevention.

AB  - AimS: Stiff man syndrome (SMS) is a rare neurological condition, characterised by rigidity and spasm, primarily of the trunk and lower extremities. We report a case of a SMS and review the literature. Method(s): A 42-year-old male patient presented to the Eye Casualty with acute onset of visual and gait disturbances. At presentation, he was only able to take few steps with two assistants. Examination showed downbeat nystagmus, ataxia, increased lower limb tone and brisk reflexes. Investigations revealed markedly elevated anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Several MRI brain and spine and whole body CT scans were performed and these showed no abnormalities, except disc prolapsed at L5-S1. Patient had 5 cycles of plasmapheresis, physiotherapy and occupational therapy input and muscle relaxants. At subsequent follow-ups, his gait and nystagmus improved and at 18-month follow-up, he was able to navigate with only one stick. Results : SMS was first described in 1956 by Moresch and Woltman in a case report of 14 patients seen over 27 years. It occurs as an idiopathic or paraneoplastic condition, and may be associated with antibodies to GAD or the 128kD synaptic protein amphiphysin. Treatment focuses on modification of the immune response and enhancement of GABAergic activity. Conclusion(s): This report summarises a typical presentation of the rare SMS.

AB  - Objective: To describe a unique case of anti-glycine receptor antibody causing relapsing progressive encephalitis with rigidity and myoclonus. Background(s): Progressive encepalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) is a rare disorder presenting subacutely with rigidity, muscle spasms, brainstem signs and hyperekplexia. Glycine receptors concentrated in the caudal pontine brainstem are responsible for mediating the normal startle response. Hyperekplexia results from disruption of this normal inhibitory pathway. Method(s): Observational case study. Result(s): In 2001, a 54 year old man presented with 2 weeks of left flank tingling and myoclonic jerks triggered by sensory and auditory stimuli. He developed bilateral ptosis, bilateral partial horizontal gaze palsies, hyperekplexia and rigidity of spine & lower limbs. CSF showed a lymphocytosis. EMG was consistent with PERM. His symptoms worsened and he was commenced on immunomodulatory therapy including high dose IV methylprednisolone, IV immunoglobulin, plasma exchange and IV cyclophosphamide. After initial improvement he deteriorated again 14 months later. Following more aggressive immunotherapy he remained stable for eight years until he presented with worsened ptosis, recurrent ophthalmoplegia, mild hyperekplexia, worsened limb rigidity and impaired mobility. He required admission and further immunosuppressive therapy. Anti-glycine receptor antibodies were initially identified in sera.They disappeared following treatment but during the 2011 relapse they were once again identified in both sera and CSF. Repeated MRI brain and spinal imaging has been normal, as have CT scans of his thorax, abdomen and pelvis with no evidence of an occult neoplasm. Serial testing for anti-Hu,-Yo,- Ri,- GAD,- MAG,-GM1 and -GQ1B antibodies have also been negative. Conclusion(s): This patient presented with hyperekplexia, rigidity and brainstem signs consistent with a diagnosis of PERM due to a pathogenic anti-glycine receptor antibody. Although a monophasic illness is usually reported, this patient's disease course has been relapsing requiring long term immunosuppressive therapy. High serum antibody titres correlate with disease activity.

AU  - Rakocevic G.

AB  - Introduction: Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is usually idiopathic, but it can be a paraneoplastic manifestation of certain tumors, most commonly secondary to breast adenocarcinoma and small cell lung cancer and associated with anti-amphiphysin antibodies. In both cases there is impaired synaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic neurotransmission resulting from autoantibodies targeting various presynaptic and synaptic proteins in the inhibitory neurons of the brain and spinal cord. Objective(s): The authors describe a patient with glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (anti-GAD) positive and amphiphysin negative antibody SPS and long-standing cutaneous T cell lymphoma treated successfully with multiple courses of T cell- and B celldepleting monoclonal antibodies with near-resolution of her SPS symptoms. Method(s): The patient is a 57-year-old woman diagnosed with T cell lymphoma at age 40 years, who underwent initial cytoxan treatments followed by intermittent rituximab infusions. She was diagnosed with GAD-positive SPS at age 46 years and treated with oral steroids and intermittent plasma exchanges without benefit. Result(s): The patient's lymphoma exacerbations have been associated with worsening of SPS in general. In addition to intermittent rituximab infusions for lymphoma relapses and as a maintenance therapy over years, she has also received alemtuzumab, bexarotene, tacrolimus, and azathioprine on separate occasions with a dramatic improvement of truncal stiffness and gait stability. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) was given for chemotherapy-induced hypogammaglobulinemia and frequent sinusitis and respiratory infections, with near-resolution of SPS-related painful muscle spasms. Conclusion(s): SPS symptoms benefit from T and B cell-targeted therapies. Early detection and the treatment of primary cancer associated with sporadic or paraneoplastic SPS are crucial for a patient's survival and neurological outcome.

AU  - Waltrous J.D.
AU  - Nieves J. 
PY  - 2012
PD  - /
AB  - Case Description: The patient began having difficulty ambulating 4 months prior to admission. A neurologist initiated an outpatient workup. Her difficulty with ambulation progressed until she was seen in the emergency department. The workup consisted of a lumbar puncture (LP) and MRI of the brain and spine. Imaging was negative; however, some of the LP results were pending upon discharge. She then began experiencing "back stiffness" and further gait unsteadiness until she could not ambulate independently. She saw another neurologist who sent her to the emergency department for further workup. The original LP results were positive for anti- GAD 65 antibodies which were suggestive of Stiff Person Syndrome. She was prescribed diazepam, which provided symptomatic improvement. She was also given 5 days of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) prior to transfer to acute rehabilitation. Program Description: A 25-year-old woman with Stiff Person Syndrome. Setting(s): Inpatient acute rehabilitation hospital. Results or Clinical Course: After treatment in acute care, the patient could ambulate short distances with a rolling walker. Following acute rehabilitation, she was modified independent with community distance ambulation, transfers, and activities of daily living. Discussion(s): Stiff Person Syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder with an unknown prevalence defined by rigidity, axial muscle spasm, and progressive muscle stiffness. Important associations with this disease are most commonly type 1 diabetes and paraneoplastic syndromes. Anti-GAD antibodies are present in approximately 60% of patients, with a high concentration typically seen in cerebrospinal fluid. Electromyography reveals continuous motor unit activity in the paraspinals or lower extremities which is abolished by intravenous diazepam. First line treatment is diazepam. Baclofen and IVIG for 3-5 days are other options. Conclusion(s): Stiff Person Syndrome is a rare, autoimmune disorder where great improvements in quality of life can be made if recognized early.

AB  - Background: Some patients with epilepsy and autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-A) also develop stiff person syndrome (SPS). The clinical characteristics and pathological correlates of this overlap syndrome are not well described. Method(s): We describe the presentation, intracranial EEG, imaging and neuropathology of two patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) who developed SPS after temporal lobectomy. GAD-A were subsequently identified in both patients. Result(s): Patient 1 had right-sided more often than left-sided epileptic seizures, as well as non-epileptic seizures. MRI showed mild hippocampal asymmetry, without abnormal signal. PET showed right temporal hypometabolism. She underwent right-sided resection 4 years after epilepsy onset. She developed SPS 3 years later. Patient 2 had a left hippocampal seizureonset zone. Serial MRIs showed progressive left hippocampal atrophy and signal abnormality. He underwent resection 7 years after developing epilepsy and developed SPS 5 months later. Neither patient had evidence of other autoimmune or endocrine disease, nor other risk factors for epilepsy. Pathology in both cases showed granule cell dispersion and cell loss in CA4 with relative preservation of other CA areas. Conclusion(s): TLE in the setting of GAD-A may be associated with the late development of SPS and a distinct form of hippocampal sclerosis.

AB  - Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) has been described with GlyR antibodies. We studied patients referred for testing whose IgG antibodies bound to GlyR alpha1 expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. 42 sera (60% males; 2-77y, median 51y) were positive, with titres up to 1:5120. Undiluted CSFs were positive in 14/15. The IgG1 antibodies bound to anterior horn cell neurons, and increased internalisation of HEK cell GlyRs. Some patients had a monophasic disease, but many slowly progressed or relapsed. Excessive startle, painful spasms (often touch-sensitive), stiffness, and rigidity were found in 90%. Brainstem disturbance leading to oculomotor abnormalities, dysphagia, dysarthria or trismus were also common (60%). Autonomic or cognitive involvement, seizures or sleep disturbance were less frequent (up to 30%). MRI and CSF findings were often uninformative but two had thymomas and one had a lymphoma. All patients received symptomatic treatments and most improved substantially with steroids and plasma exchange or IvIg, but relapses have occurred, and delayed diagnosis may have been responsible for three deaths. The clinical spectrum of this immunotherapy-responsive condition is wide and not all the patients can be defined as PERM.

AB  - Introduction: Stiff-person or stiff-limb syndrome is rare progressive disease of unknown etiology characterized by severe axial and/or limb rigidity and spasms resulting in vocational disability and social isolation. Symptomatic therapy that traditionally includes GABA-ergic medications, immunomodulation with a front-loaded methylprednisolone regimen, plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulins and benzodiazepines is not effective as it would like to be. Materials/Methods: Two woman 51 and 53 years old with stiff-limb syndrome. Spasticity of limbs according to Ashworth scale was 5 points. The first patient spent 7 years and the second 3 years in total social isolation. The first patient previously was underwent surgery for supposed cervical myelopathy. They had difficulties in positioning and couldn't walk, sit, to be mobilized in a wheelchair, transferred to toilet. They spend all time in the bed being absolutely dependent on outside help. Both were severe depressed. The second patient suffered from tonic convulsions initiated by touching, loud sound and had left equinovarus. In the second case stiff-person syndrome was confirmed by increased level of anti-GAD antibodies. Result(s): By intrathecal baclofen pump both patients had a significant improvement in their symptoms and quality of life. In both cases mood improved significantly. In first case it became available to position patient, to mobilize her in wheelchair, to transfer to toilet, to car. Second patient got partial functional independence at home. In one month after pump implantation she began to walk with stilts by herself to toilet, to take shower, to dress, her convulsions solved. She would be able to walk outside by herself, but left equinovarus deformity still doesn't let to do that. Discussion(s): Outcomes of these two cases suggests that treating patients with Stiff-Person Syndrome with intrathecal baclofen by intrathecal baclofen pump is more efficient comparing with others modalities. Conclusion(s): Intrathecal baclofen therapy in patients with stiff-person syndrome results in significant improving their quality of life making them partially independent or facilitating caring of them.

AB  - Purpose: Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune neurologic disorder characterized by progressive rigidity and stiffness, superimposed by spasms, often leading to disability and deformities. Autoantibodies block gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. Because of the autoimmune etiology, Therapeutic Plasma Exchange (TPE) has been demonstrated to be of clinical value in the treatment of SPS; although currently TPE for SPS is an ASFA category IV indication. We report our experience in the management of a patient with SPS who has been treated with maintenance TPE at UT Southwestern Medical Center since February 2011. Case: This is a forty-year old Caucasian female referred by neurology for outpatient TPE following several failed courses of IVIG and Rituximab. At the time of initiation of TPE, patient was experiencing tenacious muscle rigidity, worsening stiffness, involving muscles of abdominal wall that resulted in restricted breathing, agoraphobia and severe anxiety including an overactive startle response. She was under psychiatric care because of inability to go out in public due to fear of people watching her fall/stumble. Her speech was slurred and monotonous and she was experiencing shortness of breath with minimal exertion. She was having severe fatigue and sedation as intolerable side effects of her medications, baclofen and valium. The patient's initial TPE schedule began with three procedures per week; then the frequency was tapered gradually guided by patient's clinical response, she is currently receiving TPE every 2-3 weeks. Initial Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase (GAD56) serum antibody level was high as 3898 nmol/L (reference range<0.02) at the time of initiation of TPE. Following initial TPE course GAD56 antibody level dropped to 257 nmol/ L, then remained in the range 278-394 nmol/L. The patient, her physicians and the apheresis staff have observed a dramatic improvement with initial TPE course, and a good control of symptoms on maintenance TPE. She has been able to decrease her medications doses with minimal side effects. The patient's quality of life has improved significantly as she is able to drive, care for her young children and perform her daily activities. Conclusion(s): Our case illustrates the benefits of long term maintenance TPE for a patient with SPS who had significantly improved quality of life and decreased doses of medications that had caused side effects.

AB  - Background: Orthostatic tremor (OT) is a rare movement disorder triggered exclusively by standing and accompanied by 13-18 bursting EMG patterns. Exaggerated startle, stiffness, and spasms of the axis characterize stiff person syndrome (SPS). Objective(s): To report two patients with abnormal muscle tone control heralding as OT and briefly transforming into SPS. Patients and Methods: A 77-year-old and a 55-year-old female developed disabling unsteadiness with clinical and electrophysiological evidence of OT and benefit from clonazepam. Surprisingly the clinical picture underwent a change in a short time with progressive stiffness of the axial and mainly lower limb muscles with spasms and falls. Result(s): MRI of the brain, cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine was normal. Results of antibody testing revealed anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD) antibodies in the blood (>2000 IU/mL), whereas amphiphysin antibodies were absent. A search for an underlying neoplasm revealed no abnormalities. They were now diagnosed as having classic SPS and treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) conferred significant improvement. Conclusion(s): Brainstem and spinal cord hyperexcitability conditions give rise to progressive alterations of muscle tone, posture and voluntary movement which are potentially immunotherapy-responsive. In this regard, OT observed in our patients can be considered as a "prodromal and soft sign" of a more complex and ongoing muscle tone dis-control. A search also for autoimmunity in a specific patient with "isolated OT" can be used to prompt for the most accurate clinical investigation and to choose the most timely and appropriate therapy.

AB  - Background: The stiff-man syndrome (SMS) is one of the syndromes of hyperactivity neuromuscular, it may be associated with neoplasias in paraneoplastic syndromes. We report 2 cases of stiff man syndrome. Observation: Our patients were aged 54 years and 25 years, she had no particular history and had axial stiffness and rigidity with abnormal posture. Spasms were present. The rest of the neurological examination was normal, no pyramidal signs, extrapyramidal disorders, sensory or cognitive disabilities. MRI brain and spinewere normal. Electromyography showed continuous motor activity of axial muscles. CSFwas normal in our two patients. Anti- GAD could not be made. The physical examination showed a swelling of the breast with axillary lymph nodes, which led to a puncture and cyto-pathologic analysis revealing carcinomas. The antibodies antiamphiphysin could not be measured due to lack of resources. We observed an improvement in the clinical condition diazepam, baclofen and chemotherapy. Conclusion(s): The stiff man syndrome associated with breast cancer is described in the literature, the diagnosis of this syndrome is not always obvious to the clinician and requires research associated pathologies.

AB  - Case Description: A 56-year-old man with past medical history significant for multiple spinal surgeries, chronic back pain, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presented with fever, leukocytosis, rhabdomyolysis, and progressively increasing muscle spasms. Patient presented with creatine kinase level over 24,000, white blood cell count of approximately 20,000, and elevated creatine of 1.65. Patient reported that his back and lower extremity spasms started in 2010 after back surgery and described the episodes as a tightening of his abdominal muscles followed by lower extremity jerking. Patient had previously undergone extensive workup with brain MRI the year before, with no visible abnormalies observed. Patient underwent C-spine MRI which showed multi-level disk protrusion with no spinal cord compromise. Patients had also undergone T-spine/L-spine MRI which showed no spinal or foraminal compromise with multilevel laminectomy and fusion. Blood and urine cultures were pan negative for patient since admission. The anti-GAD antibody titer ordered earlier to admission was found to be markedly elevated at >250 (ref range 0-5), consistent with the autoimmune variant of Stiff- Person Syndrome (SPS). Setting(s): Tertiary Care Hospital. Results or Clinical Course: Patient was subsequently treated with IVIG. From his initial presentation with rhabdomyolysis, the patient's creatine kinase level and leukocytosis had trended down to normal limits within two to three weeks. Discussion(s): SPS has typically been divided into three different categories. The autoimmune variant group describe patients with anti-GAD, anti-islet-cell, as well as other autoantibodies. SPS patients with the paraneoplastic variant does not feature the presence of anti-GAD, anti-islet cell antibodies. Rather, paraneoplastic variants are often associated with the presence of anti-amphiphysin antibodies. The third category of SPS is the idiopathic variant that include patients without autoantibody production or other clinically apparent disease processes. This is the first reported case, to our knowledge, of the occurrence of rhabdomyolysis in a patient with the autoimmune variant of SPS. Conclusion(s): Rhabdomyolysis is a possible presentation in patients with the autoimmune variant of SPS.

AB  - A 45-year-old man was admitted because of painful muscle spasms and weakness. He had been well until 7 months before admission when stiffness and cramping developed in both legs, associated with pain in the back. On examination, he was anscious and in pain. Motor testing of the legs was limited because of pain and spasms induced by movement and stimulation. There was extreme rigidity of the flexor and extensor muscles bilaterally, with normal reflexes. Gait was hobbled, and the patient could only take stiff, rigid steps with a walker. Clinical presentation was consistent with Stiff-person syndrome (SPS), a rare autoimmune neurological disorder. SPS may be associated with several autoimmune diseases. Paraneoplastic SPS accounts for approximately 5% of all cases. Malignancy are more often breast cancer and small cell lung cancer. Laboratory analysis revealed mild liver functional test impairment and hypercalcemia (11 mg/dL). Total body Computerized Tomography showed hepatic mass (85x80x65 mm), abdominal lymphadenomegalies, several nodules in lungs and diffuse osteolytic lesions. Liver biopsy was perfomed and revealed cholangiocarcinoma. He was diagnosed with SPS due to cholangiocarcinoma, as never described before in medical literature. Treatment was initiated with oral diazepam and valproic acid. He gradually improved in functional status and diminished pain until normal gait in few days. Chemotherapy was soon started.

AB  - We describe the case of a 72 year old woman who presented with sequential cranial nerve palsies preceded by irritation, pain and a vesicular rash in the sensory distributions of the affected nerves. She had signs and symptoms suggestive of aphagia and Ramsey-Hunt syndrome. Further vesicular eruptions roughly obeying dermatomal boundaries on the limbs and trunk were observed. She was initially thought to have disseminated VZV/ HZV infection and was commenced on IV aciclovir. Investigations seeking evidence for viral particles in skin lesions and CSF, and for evidence of immunosuppression or malignancy, were all negative. Between days 35 and 40 she developed hypertension, seizures, a left facial nerve palsy and encephalopathy. This was complicated by a pneumonia requiring invasive ventilation on intensive care. She developed an itchy maculopapular rash with vesiculation of all four limbs. On day 66 she developed truncal and limb rigidity, which became extreme over two weeks, and was associated with pyramidal weakness. The rash was biopsied demonstrating a leucocytoclastic vasculitis. At the nadir of her illness she was encephalopathic, tracheostomy-and NG feeding- dependent, quadriparetic and bedbound due to severe rigidity (leading rapidly to Achilles tendon contractures). She was found to be glycine receptor (GlyR) antibody positive, without antibodies against amphiphysin or GAD65. She was initially treated with a combination of corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), resulting in resolution of her cranial nerve palsies, and a reduction in her rigidity and rash. Imaging using CT, PET, USS and mammography was undertaken to exclude malignancy-associated antibody production. MRI imaging of the brain and spinal cord was essentially normal. CSF analysis demonstrated only the presence of intrathecal IgG synthesis. Her treatment and rehabilitation continues. This case adds to the small number of reports in the literature of a Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) plus syndrome considered to be caused by antibodies directed against the extracellular GlyR target on the synaptic neuronal surface.1 2 Our case demonstrates further clinical variability within this unusual disorder. The GlyR is expressed in skin, and the presence of zoster-like dermatological lesions may provide a clinical clue as to the underlying aetiology in similar cases. Many of the features seen in this case have been previously described, however in this case the features emerged sequentially with rigidity, the cardinal feature of this group of diseases, emerging last. The clinical manifestations of the cases of GlyR antibody associated SPS plus disease described, closely resemble the clinical manifestations of genetic mutations of GlyR subunits and associated proteins, and of poisoning with the GlyR antagonist strychnine. This adds to the evidence that these antibodies play a direct role in the pathogenesis of disease, and that the use of immunosuppressive treatment is justified. Indeed our patient has made a substantial recovery with aggressive immunotherapy. To date no associated malignancy has been associated with GlyR antibody-mediated SPS plus disease, and our case supports these findings.

AB  - Background Muscle cramp, twitching and stiffness are common symptoms reported by patients attending the neuromuscular clinic. In a proportion of patients, these symptoms may be due to an acquired peripheral nerve hyperexcitabilty syndrome, including benign cramp fasciculation syndrome (BCFS) and disabling neuromyotonia (NMT) or Isaac's syndrome. Antibodies to voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKC) can be detected in approximately 40% of patients with NMT. Recent literature highlights that antibodies which bind to VGKC-associated proteins may also be involved[1]. We reviewed a cohort of patients attending the muscle clinic, who had their sera tested for VGKC- antibodies based on their symptoms and examination findings. Methods We retrospectively studied 44 patients who attended the muscle clinic during a 6-month period (April 2012- September 2012). All patients had their sera tested for VGKC- antibodies. Most (31/44; 70%) were also tested for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) autoantibodies, which are usually elevated in stiff person syndrome (SPS). The majority (37/44; 84%) were further investigated with neurophysiology. Patients were diagnosed on the basis of their clinical features and investigation results. Those diagnosed with BCFS or NMT were further studied to ascertain specific diagnostic features. Results Muscle cramp, twitching or stiffness was reported in 40 of 44 patients (91%) with cramp being the most frequently reported symptom (34/44; 77%). However, only 6 patients (14%) tested positive for VGKC-antibodies and 5 were positive for GAD-antibodies, including 2 patients who were positive for both VGKC and GAD antibodies. Neurophysiology was carried out in 37 (84%) patients. An underlying neuropathy was present in 9 patients. EMG findings included spontaneous activity in 8 patients, myopathic changes in 3, neurogenic changes in 1 and a further patient who displayed mixed myopathic-neurogenic features on EMG. A third of patients (15/44; 34%) were diagnosed with BFCS or NMT, 2 of these were felt to have symptoms overlapping with SPS. All patients reported cramp, twitching or muscle stiffness and 60% of them reported two of these symptoms. Five patients had raised VGKC-antibodies, including one patient who was also positive for GAD-antibodies. Another patient who was positive for both VGKC and GAD antibodies was felt to have a clinical diagnosis of SPS rather than NMT. EMG supported the diagnosis of BFCS/NMT in 4 patients who were otherwise negative for VGKC-antibodies. Another 6 patients were diagnosed with BCFS based on clinical impression despite negative EMG studies and negative VGKC-antibodies. Conclusions Although patients' initial symptoms suggested peripheral nerve hyperexcitability, VGKC-antibodies were detected in only a small proportion of patients. It would be interesting to study how many of these patients would turn out to have antibodies to the VGKC-complexed protein, contactin-associated protein-2 (CaspR2).1 If the yield to the latter proved high, then testing for these antibodies would be of significant diagnostic value.

AB  - Introduction: Paraneoplastic syndromes are remote effect of cancer involving central and peripheral nervous system. The pathogenetic mechanism of tissue damage consists in immune attack mediated by circulating antibodies recognizing both neoplastic antigens and nervous tissue epitopes. Material(s) and Method(s): We reviewed the clinical and laboratory data of definite paraneoplastic syndrome studied in our department during the period 2002 - 2011. Detection of onconeuronal antibodies was obtained by western blot analysis (recognizing anti-Hu, Yo, Ri, CV2, Ma1, Ma2, amphiphysin), and confirmed by indirect immunocytochemistry. Result(s): We identified 68 patients with definite diagnosis of paraneoplastic syndrome. 29 cases developed a neuropathy, 21 cases presented cerebellar degeneration, 2 cases limbic encephalitis, 2 cases cognitive impairment, and 1 case stiff person syndrome, brainstem encephalitis and choreic syndrome. The onconeuronal antibodies more frequently identified were anti-Hu and anti-Yo antibodies. In 26 out of 45 patients the neurologic syndrome heralded the diagnosis of cancer. In 2 cases sural nerve biopsy revealed asymmetric axonal degeneration and axonal loss, perivascular inflammatory infiltrates of B and T lymphocytes were also present in epineural space. In 2 cases with encephalitis the neuropathological examination was characterized by perivascular inflammatory infiltrations of lymphocytes and microglial activation. Conclusion(s): The present study underlines the importance of detection of onconeuronal antibodies in patients with paraneoplastic syndrome that can herald the diagnosis of cancer. Our data confirm the association between paraneoplastic neuropathy with anti-Hu antibodies, and paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration with anti-Yo antibodies detection. Pathological findings demonstrate an inflammatory involvement supporting the hypothesis of a cell-mediated injury.

AB  - Introduction GravesTM disease is a common autoimmune disease that causes hyperthyroidism. Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune neurologic disorder and is associated with anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies. SPS has been reported in association with other autoimmune diseases such as insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, pernicious anemia, and vitiligo among others (1). However the association between the GravesTM disease and SPS has been described before in only rare cases. Here we present a patient with GravesTM disease who was later diagnosed with SPS with GAD-ab. Clinical Case The patient is a 29 year-old male who was evaluated in endocrinology clinic after a recent admission to an inpatient psychiatry unit for suicidal attempt where he was found to have abnormal thyroid function tests. The patient complained of feeling fatigue, poor sleep, and weight gain of about 2-3 pounds for the last 2 to 3 months. Positive findings in the physical exam included an enlarged, non-tender thyroid with no ophthalmopathy. Blood work showed elevated free T4: 2.32 ng/dl (0.93-1.7 ng/dl) and low TSH: 0.008 mcunit/ml (0.24.2 mcunit/ml). Further work up done revealed, thyroglobulin antibody: 2946 IU/ml (0150 IU/ml), thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies: >1000 IU/ml (09.0 IU/ml), thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI) antibodies: 263% (<= 110%). Patient had radioactive iodine uptake scan which showed 29% uptake at 4 to 6 hours (normal range 8 to 18%). The patient refused to complete the 24 hour thyroid uptake. These findings were consistent with diffuse toxic goiter (Graves' disease). He was treated with 12 mCi of RAI 131. During this same time, the patient was also evaluated in the neurology clinic for spasticity and gait difficulty with a limp in the left lower extremity. Initially his symptoms were occasional; however they had progressed over the last two years. The patient could no longer ambulate easily due to these complaints. His physical examination showed evidence of diffuse hyper-reflexia with ankle clonus and increased tone that was worse in the left lower extremity. MRI of the brain and lumbosacral spine was normal except for degenerative changes in the spine. Creatine kinase (CK) levels, electromyography (EMG) and a nerve conduction study all showed normal results. Serum GAD-antibodies were >250 IU/ml (0-5.0 IU/ml). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) GAD antibodies were negative, however we believe that the sample was mishandled and not placed on ice as recommended. Due to his history of back and leg spasms, increased muscle tone and positive GAD antibodies, the patient was diagnosed with SPS and prescribed baclofen with good improvement in spasticity. Discussion Our goal is to create physician awareness about the association between these two treatable disorders to avoid patient disability and reduced quality of life especially in cases with SPS.

AB  - A 58-year-old male presented with reflex myoclonus and stiffness of the left facial, tongue, shoulder, and lower limbs muscles. Muscle stiffness and gait progressively worsened, leading to frequent falls. Acoustic and cutaneous stimuli of head precipitated reflex myoclonus like head retraction. Cutaneous of lower extremities precipitated jerky myoclonus of bilateral lower extremities. CSF analysis were unremarkable. No anti GAD antibody or anti amphiphysin antibody was detected in the serum and CSF. On surface EMG the spasms initiated with 4-5 short burst discharges at intervals between 59 and 84 ms, followed by a tonic decrescendo activity up to 3 s. After diazepam treatment, stiffness and reflex myoclonus of lower extrimiteties were disappeared and head retraction like reflex myoclonus was improved but remained. CT of the chest revealed a mediastinal tumor. Biopsy of the tumor revealed undifferential carcinoma. The patient further improved after the resection of the tumor. These findings suggest that this stiff-man syndrome may occur as an autoimmune paraneoplastic syndrome of CNS.

AB  - A 59-year-old woman with a past history of pigmentary retinopathy developed progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity (PEWR) characterized clinically by cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal signs and stiffness with painful muscle spasms. At the same period, retinopathy strikingly worsened. Her serum contained antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). She developed diabetes mellitus under corticotherapy, which was inefficient. Neurologic signs dramatically improved with diazepam and high dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (i.v. Ig). Anti-GAD antibodies have been described in stiff man syndrome, but in only one previous case of PEWR. Presence of such autoantibodies in serum and improvement following i.v. IgG infusion strongly suggest an autoimmune mechanism involving, in out case central nervous system, pancreas and probably retina.

AB  - Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) is a rare and disabling disorder characterised by continuous motor unit activity causing severe rigidity and episodic spasms in axial and limb muscles. It deteriorates the quality of life and causes a serious burden in the patient's life. Here we describe a male patient with stiff person syndrome having atypical features like pyramidal signs and generalised convulsions. Benzodiazepines, baclofen and IVIG did not alter the clinical status whereas oral methylprednisone had a dramatic effect and resulted in a favourable outcome.

AB  - SPS is a disorder that needs to be considered and recognized in patients presenting with muscle stiffness and spasms, because early diagnosis and appropriate treatment can substantially help the patient and prevent significant injuries and limitations that occur with the natural progression of the disease. A diagnosis of SPS should prompt investigation for thymoma and an occult malignancy, because SPS can be a paraneoplastic syndrome. SPS may be associated with other autoimmune diseases such as IDDM and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and a work-up for these disorders is appropriate. Symptomatic treatment with benzodiazepines and other GABAergic medications is commonly used and immunomodulating therapy, especially IVIG, is beneficial.

AB  - Following several months of low back pain, a 36-year-old man developed progressive stiffness of the abdominal, low back, and thigh muscles. On examination, these muscles demonstrated marked hypertonia consistent with the clinical diagnosis of stiff-person syndrome. The patient demonstrated increased lumbar lordosis and had focal hyperhidrosis at different sites. Electromyography showed continuous activity of the paraspinal and thigh muscles, and serum and cerebrospinal fluid antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) were markedly elevated. Diazepam and Lioresal offered partial pain relief. Paraspinal muscle administration of botulinum toxin A reduced the tone of paraspinal and thigh muscles significantly and resulted in marked improvement of ambulation and cessation of pain.

AB  - A female patient, aged 61 years, who developed a severe immobilizing stiff-person syndrome in conjunction with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, is described. In addition to the typical clinical symptoms, diagnosis was proven by the presence of autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Symptomatic treatment with continuous intrathecal application of baclofen administered by a subcutaneous pump resulted in rapid clinical improvement so that the patient became ambulatory. Intermittent withdrawal from intrathecal baclofen therapy led to complete remanifestation of stiff-person syndrome within 18 h; after re-introduction of intrathecal therapy stiffness disappeared completely within 48 h. The clinical course has been stable now for over 24 months and stiffness has completely disappeared. The effect of baclofen in this patient is discussed in the light of the suggested pathophysiological mechanisms in stiff-person syndromes.

AB  - BackgroundStiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare progressive autoimmune disease that is especially uncommon in the pediatric population. SPS is often undiagnosed for years.CaseHere we present a 12 year-old girl with a history of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus who presented with epigastric pain and whole body rigidity to a hospital in Eldoret, Kenya. A high-clinical suspicion led to targeted autoimmune testing and diagnosis in 15 days. The serum anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) level was greater than 2000 (normal 0-10 IU/ml), strongly supporting the diagnosis of stiff-person syndrome plus. The patient recovered with diazepam, baclofen, and supportive care. Intravenous immunoglobulin was unavailable due to the patient's economic constraints and challenges in accessing the health facility. Several weeks later she returned with recrudescence of her symptoms.ConclusionWe hope this case presentation will help illustrate the need to build care systems that can address the longitudinal care of patients with neurologic diseases in resource-limited settings.

AB  - to investigate stiff person syndrome(SPS) in Chinese patients. Combining 192 patients currently reported in China with previous literature review, the authors report the disease incidence, pathogenesis, clinical manifestation, treatment methods, causes of death and related research progress. The occurrence of this disease is mainly due to influenza and tumor induced, characterized by fluctuating muscle rigidity and spasm of features. It often influences trunk and limb muscles. When respiratory muscle is affected, it would lead to death. In conclusion, SPS is a disease which may relate to immune system. Its diagnosis mainly relies on the examination of clinical symptoms. Benzodiazepines can be used as experimental medication and electromyography is also of great significance. Finally, benzodiazepines and TCM are both effective methods of treatment.

TI  - Use of subcutaneous immunoglobulin in stiff person syndrome: Case series

PD  - /
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been shown to be effective for the treatment of stiff person syndrome (SPS). However, some patients might not tolerate it. We report the tolerability profile of subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIg) in patients with SPS who did not tolerate IVIG. To our knowledge, the use of SCIg in SPS has not been reported before in a case series. PATIENT CONCERNS: The five patients included in this case series presented with various combinations of symptoms of spasms, axial and limb stiffness, and exaggerated responses to outside stimuli. These symptoms often lead to gait and functional impairment. DIAGNOSIS: Patients were diagnosed with classic SPS as they met the clinical criteria, which require the presence of spasms, axial rigidity, and hyperexcitability. INTERVENTIONS: Subcutaneous immunoglobulin infusion. OUTCOME(S): Five patients were identified that were treated with SCIg. Three tested positive for serum anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 antibodies prior to any treatment. The mean age at SCIg initiation was 33 years (range: 22-47). The mean duration of SPS prior to SCIg initiation was 5.9 years (range: 2.5-7). All patients used IVIG for at least two months (up to 18 months) but switched to SCIg due to IVIG side effects. Duration of SCIg use ranged from 4 months to 6 years (mean, 19.2 months). Upon switching to SCIg, the SPS symptoms remained stable. SCIg was well-tolerated in most as only one patient discontinued SCIg due to side effects. CONCLUSION(S): This case series highlights that SCIg could be a treatment option for patients with SPS, especially when IVIG is not feasible. Injection site reactions might be a limiting factor in some patients treated with SCIg. Prospective controlled studies are needed to confirm SCIg treatment durability and efficacy.Copyright © 2021 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune disease characterised by axial stiffness and episodic painful spasms. It is associated with additional autoimmune diseases and cerebellar ataxia. Most patients with SPS have high levels of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies. The aetiology of SPS remains unclear but autoimmunity is thought to play a major part. We have previously demonstrated overlap between anti-GAD ataxia and gluten sensitivity. We have also demonstrated the beneficial effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD) in patients with anti-GAD ataxia. Here, we describe our experience in the management of 20 patients with SPS. The mean age at symptom onset was 52 years. Additional autoimmune diseases were seen in 15/20. Nineteen of the 20 patients had serological evidence of gluten sensitivity and 6 had coeliac disease. Fourteen of the 15 patients who had brain imaging had evidence of cerebellar involvement. Twelve patients improved on GFD and in seven GFD alone was the only treatment required long term. Twelve patients had immunosuppression but only three remained on such medication. Gluten sensitivity plays an important part in the pathogenesis of SPS and GFD is an effective therapeutic intervention.Copyright © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare progressive neurological disorder characterised by painful muscle spasms and progressive muscle rigidity, leading in some cases to impaired ambulation. Anti-amphiphysin positive SPS is a paraneoplastic variant, frequently associated with breast carcinomas and small cell lung cancers. We report the case of a 53-year-old patient who developed symptoms of anti-amphiphysin positive SPS 3 years before being diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma. Specifically, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT), mammogram, colonoscopy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not identify malignancy during the 3 years following the onset of symptoms. Following diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma and completion of curative-intent oncological treatment, the patient experienced improvement, though not complete resolution, in his SPS symptoms. This case highlights the importance of thorough oncological workup when clinical presentation and diagnostic testing are suggestive of anti-amphiphysin positive SPS.Copyright © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

AB  - Antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), originally linked to stiff person syndrome (SPS), now denote the "GAD antibody-spectrum disorders" (GAD-SD) that also include autoimmune epilepsy, limbic encephalitis, cerebellar ataxia and nystagmus with overlapping symptomatology highlighting autoimmune neuronal excitability disorders. The reasons for the clinical heterogeneity among GAD-antibody associated syndromes remain still unsettled, implicating variable susceptibility of GABAergic neurons to anti-GAD or other still unidentified autoantibodies. Although anti-GAD antibody titers do not correlate with clinical severity, very high serum titers, often associated with intrathecal synthesis of anti-GAD-specific IgG, point to in-situ effects of GAD or related autoantibodies within the central nervous system. It remains, however, uncertain what drives these antibodies, why they persist and whether they are disease markers or have pathogenic potential. The review, focused on these concerns, describes the widened clinical manifestations and overlapping features of all GAD-SD; addresses the importance of GAD antibody titers and potential significance of GAD epitopes; summarizes the biologic basis of autoimmune hyperexcitability; highlights the electrophysiological basis of reciprocal inhibition in muscle stiffness; and provides practical guidelines on symptomatic therapies with gamma-aminobutyric acid-enhancing drugs or various immunotherapies.Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A 27-year-old female with developmental delay initially presented to the ED after a fall with several weeks of muscle weakness/stiffness, allodynia and visual changes. CT scan revealed an anterior mediastinal mass measuring 5.2 x 7.3 x 2.1 cm concerning for a thymoma. Imaging did not note compression of her tracheobronchial tree or any vasculature. Paraneoplastic workup revealed anti- Ach receptor antibodies consistent with myasthenia gravis (MG) as well as anti-GAD antibodies concerning for Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS). Prior to thymectomy she received five sessions of plasmapheresis, however, she did not require steroids or pyridostigmine. Additionally, for her SPS she was treated with diazepam, baclofen, gabapentin. METHOD(S): As her anterior mediastinal mass did not cause any compressive symptoms she was induced and intubated without any issue. Her operative course was uncomplicated, however post operatively her SPS posed significant challenges. Refractory muscle spasms, impaired bronchial hygiene and persistent dysphagia resulted in the need for a tracheostomy and PEG tube. After a prolonged ICU course, she was eventually discharged to LTAC. RESULT(S): SPS is a rare neurological disease associated with progressive axial and limb muscle rigidity with concomitant spasms. The pathophysiology of SPS typically involves autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase, the rate limiting enzyme in gamma-aminobutyric acid production. This results in hyperactivity of the motor neuron system and progressive muscle rigidity which can lead to significant challenges throughout the perioperative period (1). While the anesthetic care of a patient with anterior mediastinal mass and/or MG is well understood, the principles for management of SPS are less clear. More research is required to optimally care for these complex patients. Here we present a rare case illustrating the perioperative management of a patient with an anterior mediastinal mass as well two concurrent autoimmune neurologic diseases.

AB  - The stiff person syndrome (SPS) is an extremely rare neurological disorder with primarily immune-mediated etiology. The cardinal symptoms are progressive, fluctuating axial/proximal limb musclestiffness and spasms. The diagnosis is based on the clinical picture, electromyography examination and detection of antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD). Adverse effects of medications might preclude its use or increase in dosing, therefore symptomatic and/or immunomodulatory medical therapy might be ineffective in acute exacerbation of the disease. We present a case of a 49-year-old female with exacerbation of SPS, in whom some standard pharmacotherapy could not be introduced (clonazepam, baclofen used in the past) and doses of existing standard medications could not be increased (diazepam, gabapentin, and levetiracetam) due to adverse effects. Moreover, a newly introduced medication (methylprednisolone) also led to a serious adverse effect (severe hyperglycemia). The patient underwent therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) with good effect and no complications. We review the literature regarding the efficacy and safety profile of TPE in exacerbation of SPS unresponsive to medical therapy. The procedure seems to have a good safety profile as an adjunct therapy for exacerbation of SPS not responding to standard medical therapy in this patient population.Copyright © 2021 Piotr F.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: The main objectives of this case study are 1. Clinicians facing symptoms that are difficult to interpret should exercise caution in diagnosing conversion disorder. 2. Increasing awareness about rare neurological conditions may appear as psychogenic illnesses. 3. Clinicians be advocate for their patients. INTRODUCTION: Conversion disorder is a mental condition in which a person present with one or more symptoms of altered voluntary motor or sensory function, or other neurologic symptoms that cannot be explained by medical evaluation. Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a disabling autoimmune central nervous system disorder characterized by progressive muscle rigidity, gait impairment, with superimposed painful spasms. SPS is commonly associated with high anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody titers. The dominant antigen recognized by these antibodies is the GABA-synthesizing enzyme GAD. METHOD(S): Patient X, a 17-year-old Hispanic American female who presented to the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Clinic with the complaint of ataxia & aphasia associated with anxiety. Patient was referred by the neurology clinic after they could not establish any organic cause of her ataxia or aphasia. After thorough evaluation at the child psychiatry clinic she was given the diagnosis of anxiety secondary to ataxia and aphasia and r/o Conversion Disorder. She was initiated treatment with sertraline for her anxiety. Her sertraline dose was increased gradually up to 100 mg daily. From the beginning the patient also received counseling & physical therapy. With these combination of treatments, patient's symptoms did not get any better. Her symptoms actually got worse over time. At this point, the Child Psychiatry Clinic sent a message to the neurology clinic for further evaluation of patient due to her progressive gait and speech impairments. RESULT(S): The neurology clinic saw the patient again and did further testing. The patient was positive for high titers of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (Anti-GAD). At this point, the patient was given the diagnosis of Stiff Person Syndrome. Patient was admitted to the hospital for further management. She was treated with benzodiazepines, IV immune globulin, & steroid. Soon after discharge from the hospital, the patient was seen at the Child Psychiatric Clinic. The patient's mother reported, after the in-patient treatment, the patient's symptoms improved. DISCUSSION: It is essential for clinicians to look for neurologic & other general medical conditions while evaluating a patient with possible conversion disorder. A systematic review of 27 studies found that among 1466 patients initially diagnosed with conversion symptoms, the frequency of misdiagnosis was approximately 4 percent.References.

AB  - Background: Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) syndrome is an uncommon neurologic condition characterized by autonomic instability and severe, spastic muscular contractions. The condition is typically linked to anti-glycine receptor (anti-GlyR) autoantibodies that develop in the context of underlying autoimmunity or paraneoplastic disease. Hypothesis: De novo diagnoses of PERM syndrome may be clinically indistinguishable from glycine antagonist poisoning. Method(s): This is a single-patient case report. A six-year-old fully immunized girl with a history of sexual abuse was transferred to a tertiary care dedicated pediatric facility for evaluation of "spells" typified by generalized shaking and rigidity. The patient was reportedly awake and in obvious distress during these episodes, which were characterized by pronounced muscle contractions of the extremities and arching of the back. The patient's laboratory assessment demonstrated sequelae of rhabdomyolysis with a creatine phosphokinase (CPK) of 38,000 IU/L. Medical toxicology was consulted with concern for possible glycine antagonist poisoning. Result(s): On examination, the patient had findings consistent with opisthotonos. The patient had no clear exposure to rodenticidal agents or penetrating injuries prior to her presentation. Pending completion of her diagnostic workup, the patient was treated empirically with tetanus immunoglobulin, metronidazole, and benzodiazepines with minimal improvement in her symptoms. Subsequent MRI of the brain and tetanus antibodies returned within normal limits. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry showed no evidence of strychnine exposure. Given concern for possible autoimmune disease, the patient was started on IVIg therapy with a notable decrease in both the frequency and severity of her spasms. Prior to discharge, autoimmune titers confirmed the presence of anti- GlyR autoantibodies. Conclusion(s): PERM syndrome represents a rare glycinopathy that may mimic glycine antagonist toxicity and should be considered in the differential of patients presenting with opisthotonos, neuromuscular spasticity, and rhabdomyolysis.

AB  - Introduction: Neurological disorders are considered rare complications of immune-checkpoint inhibitor. Case description: We report a 63-year-old man with recurrence of melanoma who presented epilepsy, limbic encephalitis, cerebellar ataxia, and stiff person syndrome soon after treatment with nivolumab, an immune-checkpoint inhibitor. On autoimmune screening, serum and CSF GAD65 were detected. Significant response to steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins were observed, but cancer recurred after nivolumab discontinuation in parallel with epileptic seizure and worsening of cognitive impairment and the patient died. Discussion(s): This case expands the spectrum of GAD65-associated conditions induced by immune-checkpoint inhibitor and underlines treatment complexity when both neurological complications and tumour recurrence occur.Copyright © 2021, Fondazione Societa Italiana di Neurologia.

AB  - Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS), a rare autoimmune neurologic disorder characterized by fluctuating muscle spasms and rigidity, is mediated by autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies. Symptoms of SPS have been shown to improve after administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) however, there is a paucity of information regarding use of SCIg in SPS. Four patients with Stiff Person Syndrome were treated with SCIgPro20 for a period between 31 to 101 months. Most reactions were local and mild. All patients reported improvement in spasticity, and 2 patients reported improvement in seizure frequency. SCIgPro20 was well tolerated in patients with SPS and was associated with improvement in symptoms.

AB  - We aimed to share our rehabilitation experience in a patient diagnosed with paraneoplastic Stiff-person syndrome(SPS). A 45-year-old female patient was admitted to neurology with the complaint of widespread painful contractions. EMG was evaluated in favor of SPS. Amphiphysin-antibody was +++ in CSF. Patients' treatment was arranged and transferred to rehabilitation inpatient-clinic.The patient was included in the rehabilitation program of range of motion,stretching,strengthening, posture&walking exercises, balance&coordination exercises, 5 days/week for 3 months. The patient was screened for breast cancer, diagnosed with invasive breast carcinoma and underwent mastectomy. With the rehabilitation, the patient was mobilized first in the parallel-bar then with tripod-cane in the following months. Significant improvements were found in functional status and quality of life with control of spasticity and mobilization. Although the primary treatment of paraneoplastic SPS is cancer treatment, significant gains have been achieved with rehabilitation. It is necessary to raise awareness of the importance of rehabilitation to physicians who diagnose the disease.Copyright © 2021, International Society of Musculoskeletal and Neuronal Interactions.

AB  - Background: Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is an autoimmune condition involving antibodies against several components of the inhibitory synapse in the spinal cord, with glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies being the predominant immune marker. SPS affects approximately 1 patient per million population per year. The effect of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been established, but studies on the long-term efficacy of regular IVIG are limited. Objective(s): To review clinical details and long-term treatment response using a patient-reported questionnaire in SPS and related syndromes. Method(s): Patients were identified from a tertiary neuroimmunology clinic based on classical clinical symptoms, autoimmune profiles, and neurophysiological changes (Dalakas criteria). They were followed up after treatment to assess the response to IVIG. Result(s): A total of 23 patients fulfilled the selection criteria. Patients' demographic profiles and clinical presentations were akin to that reported in literature. There was significant improvement in the functional ability (assessed by the modified Rankin scale [mRS]) and quality of life (QoL) following treatment with IVIG within 4 to 10 weeks (pre-mRS vs. post-mRS, P < 0.0001; pre-QoL vs. post-QoL, P = 0.0003) and sustained after 5 years of treatment (pre-mRS vs. present mRS, P = 0.0003; pre-QoL vs. present QoL, P = 0.0002). Conclusion(s): This article describes one of the largest single-center experiences of 23 patients with SPS and related syndromes and is the first to establish the long-term efficacy of regular IVIG using a patient-reported scoring system (Birmingham Response to Immunomodulatory Therapy [BRIT]). Consistent improvement in QoL and functional scores were seen over nearly 5 years after regular use of IVIG. It is recommended to use BRIT scores to assess the initial response as well as to monitor continued improvement to immunomodulation in SPS.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Introduction: Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) is a neurological disorder with an incidence of one in a million cases per year. Scolioisis in patients with SPS is rarely reported. We present a 47-year old female who was initiated on BPAP due to respiratory failure while on first-line treatment for SPS. Case Presentation: A 47-year old female presented with hypophonia for 3 weeks and forty pound weight loss over six months from worsening dysphagia. Past medical history includes Classic SPS (diagnosed age 38) with a history of multiple intubations due to respiratory failure and decannulation of tracheostomy. She also complained of back pain causing difficulty breathing. Home medications included baclofen, diazepam, and trileptal, which were continued on admission with five days of IVIG. CXR showed dextrocurvature of the thoracic spine (dextroscoliosis). MRI brain showed severe dorsal cerebellar atrophy and MRI spine was unremarkable. Swallow study showed impaired oropharyngeal swallow with difficulty coordinating breathing with swallow. Given hypophonia and dysphagia not being typical features of SPS, work-up was conducted and negative for the following: myasthenia gravis, thyroid disorders, HIV, RPR, HSV, Lyme disease, WNV, Mumps, Rubeola, HTLV, ANA, ANCA, serum/urine protein electrophoresis, paraneoplastic syndromes, and vitamin deficiencies. Lumbar puncture CSF GAD was 27, confirming SPS. Four days into admission, she went into respiratory distress with oxygen saturation in the low 60s on room air. She was using accessory muscles of respiration and gasping for air. Of note, the patient received her nightly baclofen and trileptal 2 hours prior. 15L non-rebreather mask was started without significant improvement, therefore BPAP 10/5, FiO2 50% was initiated. The patient was DNI. Initial arterial blood gas showed PaCO2 120 that improved to 80 with BPAP. Her respiratory status improved throughout hospitalization and she was weaned down to BPAP 7/4 (Fio2 30%) while asleep without supplemental oxygen use during wakeful hours. Her mobility and dysphagia/hypophonia also improved after working with physical therapy and speech pathology, respectively. Discussion(s): Respiratory failure can result from progression of SPS due to muscle spasms, diaphragmatic weakness, and chest wall rigidity. Our patient also suffered from scoliosis, which may have worsened respiratory compliance. Unfortunately, first line treatments for SPS include benzodiazepines and baclofen which are well-known to cause respiratory depression. By utilizing BPAP, IVIG, physical therapy, and other supportive measures, our patient improved and we were able to prevent further episodes of acute respiratory failure while she was on first-line SPS therapy.

AB  - Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) is an extremely rare neurological condition characterized by muscle stiffness and painful muscle spasms. The symptoms often progress slowly and can cause disability. Antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD) have been reported in up to 80% of the classic type of SPS. Paraneoplastic syndrome comprises 5% of SPS cases. These patients present with different malignancies including lung, thymus, breast, colon, and lymph nodes. In this paper, we report a case of a 25-year-old Vietnamese female patient with SPS presenting with unusual clinical manifestations of sudden onset, rapidly progressive spinal, abdominal, and lower limb rigidity accompanied by painful spasms, autonomic disorders, and severe, multiple bone fractures. Serologic tests detected high-titer anti-GAD, combined with anti-SOX1 antibodies, suggesting paraneoplastic SPS. Intravenous immunoglobulin has been employed as the main treatment therapy, and the patient has had a complete remission.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a specific neurological condition, as it's both rare and unique. SPS is distinguished by muscle rigidity that occurs in waves with simultaneous painful and debilitating muscular spasms. Tactile or auditory stimuli can induce spasms. On electromyographic study, the patient has continuous motor activity, very similar to tetanus. The syndrome can lead to difficulty doing essential daily tasks or even painful conditions like fractures. Apart from clinical signs, some patients have positive anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD) antibodies, which can also be an excellent confirmatory test for diagnosing SPS. In this case report, we present a 36-year-old female with a long history of SPS, with positive anti-GAD antibodies, leading to her chronic dependence on a tracheostomy tube and the pulmonary complications that followed. The patient suffered from acute encephalopathy secondary to acute respiratory failure. She was placed on a mechanical ventilator due to her respiratory failure but later developed a case of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Respiratory complications have not been reported vividly with this syndrome, so this case sheds light on the same.

AB  - Introduction: Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune neurological disorder associated with muscle rigidity and spasms. A number of antibodies have been associated with disorder, including anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase and anti-amphiphysin.Case report; In this report, we present a rare case of a 79-year-old woman who presented with bilateral lower extremity weakness who was ultimately diagnosed with stiff-limb syndrome, a rare variant of SPS. Extensive laboratory and CSF studies were unrevealing. Electromyography showed significant peroneal motor neuropathy and complex repetitive discharges in the left tibialis anterior muscle. Antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase were significantly elevated at 124 units/mL. She was subsequently started on oral diazepam with significant improvement in her symptoms.Conclusion: The presentation of SPS can vary based on epidemiologic factors, clinical symptoms, and associated disorders. These forms can have overlapping features which may make the categorization of patients into one of these forms challenging.

AB  - Intrathecal baclofen therapy is a recognized treatment for severe spasticity. We report here a case of stiff person syndrome in Australia, treated with intrathecal baclofen followed by a rehabilitation programme with substantial clinical and functional improvements. A 59-year-old woman diagnosed with stiff person syndrome had become hoist-dependent and required full care due to severe spasticity over the past 12 years. Treatment with oral benzodiazepines and botulinum toxin injections to the affected muscles had no therapeutic response. After a test dose of 100 pg intrathecal baclofen resulted in a substantial improvement in her physical function, a decision was made to insert an intrathecal baclofen delivery device. This case report supports the use of intrathecal baclofen therapy and a formal inpatient rehabilitation programme for spasticity related to stiff person syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intrathecal baclofen is considered an adjuvant therapy for patients with intractable spasms due to stiff-person syndrome. There is increasing evidence to support the use of intrathecal baclofen in the management of symptomatic stiffperson syndrome, with improvement in function. CASE REPORT: A 38-year-old woman with stiff- person syndrome initially presented to inpatient rehabilitation for intractable muscle spasms. The symptoms made her non-ambulatory and limited her tolerance to wheelchair use for mobility. The patient underwent up-titration of oral baclofen and diazepam, with concurrent intravenous immunoglobulin cycles, leading to transient symptom relief. She agreed to explore intrathecal baclofen therapy. An initial trial of a single bolus of 50 μg intrathecal baclofen resulted in a significant decrease in spontaneous spasms, enabling modified independence in transfers and ambulation. The patient was subsequently implanted with a permanent intrathecal delivery system. To date, the intrathecal baclofen had been titrated to 186 μg per day with simple continuous delivery. The patient was weaned off oral baclofen. She attained complete functional independence with ambulation without the need for assistive devices, and has had no lasting post-procedural complications to date. CONCLUSION: This case report adds to the increasing evidence of cases of refractory stiff-person syndrome managed successfully using intrathecal baclofen therapy.

AB  - Objective: To report clinical characteristics and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) findings in the brain and muscles of individuals with stiff person syndrome (SPS) spectrum disorders (SPSSDs). Methods: Retrospective cohort study from 1997 to 2018 at Johns Hopkins Hospital identified 170 individuals with SPS or cerebellar ataxia (CA) associated with anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD)-65 antibodies. Fifty-one underwent FDG-PET, with 50 involving the body and 30 with dedicated brain acquisition. The clinical and immunological profiles were extracted via medical record review. The brain scans were analyzed quantitatively using the NeuroQ software, with comparison with an averaged normal database. The body scans were reviewed qualitatively by a blinded nuclear medicine radiologist. Results: Mean age of symptom onset was 41.5 years (range 12-75 years). Majority were female (68%) and White (64%). Of the patients, 82% had SPS (majority being classic phenotype), and 18% had CA. Three had a paraneoplastic process. Forty-seven had serum anti-GAD, two with anti-amphiphysin, and one with anti-glycine receptor antibodies. Brain metabolic abnormalities were seen in both SPS and CA, with significant differences between the groups noted in the right superior frontal cortex, right sensorimotor cortex, left inferior parietal cortex, bilateral thalami, vermis, and left cerebellum. Of the patients, 62% demonstrated muscle hypermetabolism, most commonly bilateral, involving the upper extremities or axial muscles. Neither brain nor muscle metabolism was correlated with functional outcomes nor treatments. Conclusions: Metabolic changes as seen by FDG-PET are present in the brain and muscle in many individuals with SPSSD. Future studies are needed to assess whether FDG-PET can help aid in the diagnosis and/or monitoring of individuals with SPSSD.

AB  - We report an early childhood onset Stiff Limb Syndrome (SLS) in association with unusual polyautoimmunity of GAD-65, anti-islet cell, and Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) autoantibodies, who has achieved a nearly complete neurological recovery following combined immunotherapy, symptomatic and physical therapy. The patient had normal MRIs of the brain and spinal cord and a negative paraneoplastic work-up. Subsequently, she developed hypothyroidism requiring levothyroxine supplementation. We then conducted an extensive review of literature and identified 52 previously reported pediatric Stiff Man Syndrome (SMS)/Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) or SLS cases, which has demonstrated a common association with other systemic autoimmune conditions. In the available literature, screening for concurrent autoimmunity has only been reported infrequently. We found that a paraneoplastic process is extremely rare in pediatric cases. Timely diagnosis and initiation of immunotherapy are critical to a favorable outcome. Therefore, we recommend to include SMS/SPS or SLS as an important differential diagnosis for MRI-negative myelopathy. Further clinical and research efforts should be focused on understanding the role of both genetic predisposition and environmental insults in the autoimmunity of pediatric SMS/SPS or SLS.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune disease caused by lack of inhibition to excitatory neurotransmitters in the central nervous system (CNS) leading to inappropriate motor unit firing. The pathophysiology is incompletely understood; however, high titers of antiglutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (anti-GAD Ab) are strongly associated with this disease. We present a 50-year-old woman with a history of ongoing gait and balance issues for 5 years with multiple negative workups. She recently had an acute exacerbation which left her bedbound, unable to move her legs or turn from side to side. After a negative workup at an outside hospital, the patient was discharged to a subacute rehabilitation facility. She then presented to our institution due to worsening of her condition and was ultimately diagnosed with SPS which was successfully treated. We review the case presentation and treatment options in the context of a severe disabling disease presentation.

AB  - Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody-related encephalitis is an autoimmune disease associated with intracellular neuronal antigens. We report on a rare case of GAD antibody-associated encephalitis complicated with focal segmental stiffness-person syndrome (SPS) in a middle-aged woman. The disease course lasted for >10 years, initially presenting with drug-resistant epilepsy, followed by stiffness of the right lower limb, and right upper limb involvement. The patient experienced anxiety and depression symptoms due to long-term illness. During hospitalization, serum and cerebrospinal fluid GAD antibodies were positive and no tumor was found. The symptoms were significantly relieved after corticosteroid therapy and intravenous immunoglobulin immunomodulation therapy. To the best of our knowledge, this case is the first to discuss the early recognition and treatment of chronic epilepsy and focal segmental SPS caused by anti-GAD antibody-related encephalitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: IVIg has been the preferred immunotherapy in stiff-person syndrome (SPS) based on a 3-month controlled trial, but whether it is also effective in inducing long-term benefits or arresting disease progression is unknown. The information is needed because SPS is a progressively disabling disease and IVIg is liberally used as chronic therapy without efficacy data. The present study explores the long-term effects of IVIg in the largest cohort of well-characterized patients with SPS followed by the same clinicians over 10 years. METHODS: Data of 36 patients (32 glutamic acid decarboxylase [GAD] positive), diagnosed and treated with monthly maintenance IVIg by the same neurologists, were analyzed. Response was assessed by physician-observed changes, patients' reports of symptom improvement, modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores, and dependency trials evaluating symptom recurrence after stopping IVIg, prolonging infusion frequency, decreasing monthly dose, or wearing-off effects in between doses. Clinically meaningful long-term response was defined by improved mRS scores, improvement in physician-assessed stiffness, balance and gait, and functional decline with dependency trials. RESULTS: Twenty-four of 36 (67%) patients had clinically meaningful response over a median 40-month period. Patients with improved mRS scores by 1-2 points manifested improved gait, posture, balance and decreased stiffness, spasms, and startle response; some patients using a wheelchair and those ambulating with devices walked unassisted. In 25% of responders, treatment benefit was sustained for a 40-month median period, but in 29.1%, it declined over a 39-month period; 12.5% exhibited a conditioning effect. Three of 5 patients with cerebellar GAD-SPS variant also improved over time. The 12 patients who did not respond the first 3 months remained unresponsive even if IVIg continued for several months. DISCUSSION: This is a large study in 36 patients with SPS demonstrating that monthly maintenance IVIg therapy offers long-term benefits in 67% of patients for a median 3.3-year period. Because 29.1% experienced diminishing benefit over time due to disease progression, the study highlights the need for more effective therapies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stiff person syndrome spectrum disorders (SPSD) are a rare group of disabling neuroimmunological disorders. SPSD often requires immune therapies, especially in the setting of inadequate response to symptomatic treatments. The safety and efficacy of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) in SPSD remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To describe the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of TPE in patients with SPSD. DESIGN: A retrospective observational study. METHODS: A retrospective review of SPSD patients seen at Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) from 1997 to 2021 was performed. Patient demographics/history, examination/diagnostic findings, treatment response, and TPE-related complications were recorded. Assessment for any associations between clinical characteristics, including age, sex, clinical phenotype, and time on immunotherapy, and response to TPE 3 months after treatment was performed. A subgroup of 18 patients treated with TPE at JHH and 6 patients treated with TPE at outside institutions were evaluated for any change in usage of symptomatic medications 3 months after the TPE treatment. Literature review of SPSD and TPE was also conducted. RESULTS: Thirty-nine SPSD patients were treated with TPE (21 at JHH and 18 at outside institutions); median age 48 years, 77% female, median modified Rankin Scale 3; mean initial anti-GAD65 antibody titer was 23,508 U/mL. Twenty-four patients (62%) had classic SPS, 10 (26%) had SPS-plus, 2 (5%) had progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus, and 3 (8%) had pure cerebellar ataxia. All patients were on symptomatic treatments, 30 (77%) previously received IVIg, and 3 (8%) previously received rituximab. Four patients (10%) had a TPE-related adverse event. One developed asymptomatic hypotension, another had both line thrombosis and infection, and two had non-life-threatening bleeding events. Twenty-three (59%) patients reported improvement in symptoms after TPE. Of the subgroup of 24 patients evaluated for any change in usage of symptomatic medications 3 months after the TPE treatment, 14 (58%) required fewer GABAergic symptomatic medications. Literature review identified 57 additional patients with SPSD; 43 (75%) reported temporary improvement after TPE. CONCLUSION: The majority of patients treated with TPE had improvement. Moreover, most patients evaluated for any change in usage of symptomatic medications after the TPE treatment no longer required as much symptomatic medications months after TPE. TPE appears safe and well-tolerated in SPSD. Further studies are needed to assess the long-term efficacy of TPE in SPSD and identify which patients may benefit the most from TPE.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stiff person spectrum disorder (SPSD) is heterogeneous, and accurate diagnosis can be challenging. METHODS: Patients referred for diagnosis/suspicion of SPSD at the Mayo Autoimmune Neurology Clinic from July 01, 2016, to June 30, 2021, were retrospectively identified. SPSD diagnosis was defined as clinical SPSD manifestations confirmed by an autoimmune neurologist and seropositivity for high-titer GAD65-IgG (>20.0 nmol/L), glycine-receptor-IgG or amphiphysin-IgG, and/or confirmatory electrodiagnostic studies (essential if seronegative). Clinical presentation, examination, and ancillary testing were compared to differentiate SPSD from non-SPSD. RESULTS: Of 173 cases, 48 (28%) were diagnosed with SPSD and 125 (72%) with non-SPSD. Most SPSD were seropositive (41/48: GAD65-IgG 28/41, glycine-receptor-IgG 12/41, amphiphysin-IgG 2/41). Pain syndromes or functional neurologic disorder were the most common non-SPSD diagnoses (81/125, 65%). SPSD patients more commonly reported exaggerated startle (81% vs. 56%, p = 0.02), unexplained falls (76% vs. 46%, p = 0.001), and other associated autoimmunity (50% vs. 27%, p = 0.005). SPSD more often had hypertonia (60% vs. 24%, p < 0.001), hyperreflexia (71% vs. 43%, p = 0.001), and lumbar hyperlordosis (67% vs. 9%, p < 0.001) and less likely functional neurologic signs (6% vs. 33%, p = 0.001). SPSD patients more frequently had electrodiagnostic abnormalities (74% vs. 17%, p < 0.001), and at least moderate symptomatic improvement with benzodiazepines (51% vs. 16%, p < 0.001) or immunotherapy (45% vs. 13% p < 0.001). Only 4/78 non-SPSD patients who received immunotherapy had alternative neurologic autoimmunity. INTERPRETATION: Misdiagnosis was threefold more common than confirmed SPSD. Functional or non-neurologic disorders accounted for most misdiagnoses. Clinical and ancillary testing factors can reduce misdiagnosis and exposure to unnecessary treatments. SPSD diagnostic criteria are suggested.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Appendiceal goblet cell carcinoma (aGCC) is a rare neoplasm with mixed endocrine and exocrine features. No paraneoplastic neurological syndromes or autoantibodies have been identified in cases of aGCC or even appendiceal tumors. Amphiphysin-immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoimmunity was first described in stiff-person syndrome with breast cancer. We firstly described the clinical course and pathological findings of a patient with aGCC-associated amphiphysin-IgG autoimmunity. CASE PRESENTATION: A 54-year-old man who developed aGCC was admitted for acute disturbance of consciousness, psychiatric symptoms, cognitive impairment, seizure and hypotension. Amphiphysin-IgG was detected in the patient's serum and CSF by immunoblotting and tissue-based indirect immunofluorescence assay confirming the diagnosis of definite paraneoplastic amphiphysin-IgG-positive encephalitis. Histopathology revealed amphiphysin protein expression and accompanying immune cell infiltration (predominantly CD20+ B cells, CD3+ and CD8+ T cells) within the tumor tissue, suggesting a possible paraneoplastic origin of amphiphysin-associated paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNSs) in this case. Although the patient's symptoms resolved after high-dose corticosteroid therapy, he experienced recurrence 6 months later, manifesting as paraneoplastic cerebellar dysfunction. Despite treatment with IV cyclophosphamide and oral mycophenolate mofetil, no improvement was noted. CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that aGCC may trigger amphiphysin-IgG autoimmunity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the current study, seizure semiology and potential predictive factors of seizure outcomes in glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GAD Ab)-associated neurological syndrome were investigated. METHODS: In this study, 32 Chinese patients with GAD Ab-associated neurological syndrome who presented with seizures at Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January 2017 to October 2022 were reviewed; 30 had a follow-up duration of more than 1 year. RESULTS: Among the 32 patients, 10 presented with epilepsy alone. Concomitant neurological syndromes were observed in 22 patients, including limbic encephalitis (n = 20), stiff-person syndrome (SPS, n = 1), and cerebellar ataxia (n = 1). Bilateral tonic-clonic seizures were observed in 21 patients (65.6%). Focal seizures occurred in 27 patients (84.4%); 17 had focal motor seizures and 18 focal non-motor seizures. Among 30 patients with long-term follow-up, 11 (36.7%) were seizure-free. Acute/subacute onset (p = 0.049) and comorbidity of limbic encephalitis with epilepsy (p = 0.023) led to better seizure outcomes. Patients with persistent epilepsy were more likely to have focal seizure (p = 0.003) and higher frequency of seizure (p = 0.001). Furthermore, these patients tended to have longer intervals from onset to immunomodulatory treatments. Early immunotherapy (within 6 months from onset) was administered in 81.8% of seizure-free patients but only in 42.1% of patients with persistent seizures. However, steroid and immunosuppressant duration did not differ in the two groups. Repeated serum GAD Ab tests during the follow-up showed no association with seizure outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The seizure manifestations are diverse and variable. Approximately one third of patients achieved seizure remission during long-term follow-up. The type and frequency of seizures may influence the seizure outcomes. Early immunotherapy, especially within 6 months, may lead to better seizure outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To elucidate current epidemiologic, clinical, and immunologic profiles and treatments of stiff-person syndrome (SPS) in Japan., METHODS: A nationwide mail survey was conducted using an established method. Data processing sheets were sent to randomly selected departments of internal medicine, neurology, pediatrics, psychiatry, and neurosurgery in hospitals and clinics throughout Japan to identify patients with SPS who were seen between January 2015 and December 2017., RESULTS: Thirty cases were identified as glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65)-positive SPS cases on the basis of detailed clinical data of 55 cases. Four patients had alpha1 subunit of glycine receptor (GlyR) antibodies, and 1 patient had both GAD65 and GlyR antibodies. The total estimated number of patients with GAD65-positive SPS was 140, and the estimated prevalence was 0.11 per 100,000 population. The median age at onset was 51 years (range, 26-83 years), and 23 (76%) were female. Of these, 70% had classic SPS, and 30% had stiff-limb syndrome. The median time from symptom onset to diagnosis was significantly longer in the high-titer GAD65 antibody group than in the low-titer group (13 months vs 2.5 months, p = 0.01). The median modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at baseline was 4, and the median mRS at the last follow-up was 2. Among the 29 GAD65-positive patients with >=1 year follow-up, 7 received only symptomatic treatment, 9 underwent immunotherapy without long-term immunotherapy, and 13 received long-term immunotherapy such as oral prednisolone. The coexistence of type 1 diabetes mellitus and the lack of long-term immunotherapy were independent risk factors for poor outcome (mRS >=3) in the GAD65-positive patients (odds ratio, 15.0; 95% CI 2.6-131.6; p = 0.001; odds ratio, 19.8; 95% CI 3.2-191.5; p = 0.001, respectively)., DISCUSSION: This study provides the current epidemiologic and clinical status of SPS in Japan. The symptom onset to the diagnosis of SPS was longer in patients with high-titer GAD65 antibodies than in those with low-titer GAD65 antibodies. The outcome of patients with SPS was generally favorable, but more aggressive immunotherapies are necessary for GAD65-positive patients with SPS. Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Neuropathic pain is common and distressing. Improved mechanistic understanding and pharmacotherapies are urgently needed. Molecularly specific pain syndromes may provide insights with translational relevance. Glycine receptors are known to play a key role in inhibitory neurotransmission in the spinal dorsal horn and have therefore been considered as targets for analgesic development. While autoantibodies directed against glycine receptors may rarely arise spontaneously in humans, a detailed phenotype of neuropathic pain and allodynia in association with these autoantibodies has not been described., METHODS: We describe the case of a previously well adult presenting with severe neuropathic pain and allodynia as part of an autoimmune brainstem and spinal syndrome with glycine receptor autoantibodies., RESULTS: Our patient experienced a severe illness, including marked neuropathic pain and allodynia, hypoventilation, tetraparesis, and ophthalmoplegia. A diagnosis of progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus was made. Neuropathic pain was characterized with validated instruments and responded promptly to cause-directed immunotherapy., DISCUSSION: A detailed longitudinal phenotyping, using validated pain measurement instruments, of severe neuropathic pain and allodynia associated with likely pathogenic glycine receptor autoantibodies is reported. This case may have relevance for translational development of analgesics targeting glycinergic neurotransmission. Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) is a rare neurological condition with paraneoplastic etiology in about 20% of cases, usually presenting before or shortly after the oncological diagnosis is established. PERM associated with anti-glycine receptor antibodies is not previously reported in a patient with bladder cancer., CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-years-old Caucasian male was admitted with acute onset of dysarthria, dysphagia and trismus three years after initial surgical treatment for bladder cancer. The condition was initially diagnosed as tetanus and treated accordingly, but the diagnosis was reconsidered because of progression despite adequate treatment. Diagnostic workup on readmission revealed lung and paraaortal metastases from bladder cancer and anti-glycine receptor (anti-GlyR) antibodies both in the cerebrospinal fluid and in serum, which supplemented with the clinical presentation led to the diagnosis of PERM, presumably related to bladder cancer. The patient showed improvement and stabilization after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and chemotherapy against metastatic bladder cancer., CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of anti-GlyR antibody positive PERM related to urothelial carcinoma. The symptoms mimicked tetanus, and responded to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Copyright © 2023. The Author(s).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (anti-GAD65)-associated neurological disorders include two major phenotypes, namely Stiff person syndrome (SPS) and cerebellar ataxia (CA). Considering the potential for better outcomes with prompt immunotherapy, early detection of CA is crucial. Hence, a non-invasive imaging biomarker to detect CA with high specificity is desired. Herein, we evaluated brain 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) PET in detecting CA based on cerebellar uptake using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and five-fold cross-validation., METHODS: This study was based on STARD 2015 guidelines: thirty patients with anti-GAD65-associated neurological disorders, 11 of whom with CA were studied. Five test sets were created after patients were randomly sorted and divided into 5 equal folds. Each iteration included 24 patients for ROC analysis and 6 patients reserved for testing. The Z scores of left cerebellum, vermis, right cerebellum, and the average of the three regions were used in ROC analysis to determine areas with significant area under the curve (AUC). The cut-off values with high specificity were determined among the 24 patients in each iteration and tested against the reserved 6 patients., RESULTS: Left cerebellum and average of the three regions showed significant AUC above 0.5 in all iterations with left cerebellum being the highest AUC in 4 iterations. Testing the cut-off values of the left cerebellum against the reserved 6 patients in each iteration showed 100% specificity with sensitivities ranging from 0 to 75%., CONCLUSIONS: Cerebellar 18F-FDG PET uptake can differentiate CA phenotypes from patients with SPS with high specificity.

AB  - ABSTRACT: A 68-year-old woman with positional dizziness and progressive imbalance presented for vestibular evaluation. Examination was notable for spontaneous downbeat nystagmus (DBN), horizontal and vertical gaze-evoked nystagmus (GEN) with centripetal and rebound nystagmus, and positional apogeotropic nystagmus. There was also mild-moderate slowing of saccades horizontally and vertically and poor fast phases with an optokinetic stimulus. Further consultation by a movement disorder specialist uncovered asymmetric decrementing bradykinesia and rigidity, masked facies, and a wide-based stance without camptocormia. Screening serum laboratory results for metabolic, rheumatologic, infectious, heavy metal, endocrine, or vitamin abnormalities was normal. Surveillance imaging for neoplasms was unremarkable, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was negative for 14-3-3 and real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC). However, her anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase-65 (GAD65) immunoglobulin G (IgG) level was markedly elevated in serum to 426,202 IU/mL (reference range 0-5 IU/mL) and in CSF to 18.1 nmol/L (reference range <0.03 nmol/L). No other autoantibodies were identified on the expanded paraneoplastic panel. The patient was referred to neuroimmunology, where torso rigidity, spasticity, and significant paravertebral muscle spasms were noted. Overall, the clinical presentation, examination findings, and extensive workup were consistent with a diagnosis of anti-GAD65-associated stiff person syndrome-plus (musculoskeletal plus cerebellar and/or brainstem involvement). She was subsequently treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and has been stable since commencing this therapy. In patients with centripetal nystagmus, especially in association with other cerebellar findings, an autoimmune cerebellar workup should be considered.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stiff person syndrome (SPS) spectrum disorders (SPSSD) cause spasms and rigidity throughout different body regions and can be associated with apnea and acute respiratory failure. There are limited data on the prevalence and predictors of respiratory symptoms with spasms (RSwS) in SPSSD. We sought to characterize the spirometry patterns and the frequency and predictors of RSwS in a large SPSSD cohort., METHODS: Participants were recruited from the Johns Hopkins SPS Center between 1997 and 2021, as part of an ongoing, longitudinal observational study. Medical records were reviewed to assess demographics and clinical characteristics. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression models., RESULTS: One-hundred ninety-nine participants (mean age = 53.4 +/- 13.6 years, median time to diagnosis = 36 [IQR 66] months, 74.9% women, 69.8% White, 62.8% classic SPS phenotype) were included in final analyses; 35.2% of participants reported RSwS, of whom 24.3% underwent spirometry as part of routine clinical care. Obstructive (23.5%) and restrictive (23.5%) patterns were most commonly observed in those with SPSSD. An increasing number of body regions involved predicted the presence of RSwS (odds ratio [OR] = 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.50-2.53); those with >=5 body regions involved (vs. <=4) had higher odds (OR = 6.19, 95% CI = 2.81-13.62) of experiencing RSwS in adjusted models. Two patients died from SPSSD-associated respiratory compromise., CONCLUSIONS: RSwS are common in SPSSD and may be predicted by an increasing number of body regions involved by SPSSD. Close clinical monitoring and having a low threshold to obtain spirometry should be considered in people with SPSSD. Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Antibodies to Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase (GAD) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of both autoimmune Limbic Encephalitis (LE) and Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS). However, their association is quite rare. We present a case of a 48-year-old Caucasian female who presented with symptoms of recurrent severe headaches, behavioral and cognitive dysfunction, and an episode of seizure. She was found to have high titers of anti-GAD65 antibodies in both cerebrospinal fluid and serum. She was diagnosed with LE and SPS, and was started on immunosuppressive therapy with steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG). The patient responded well to treatment with improvement in her symptoms.

AB  - The role of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65 autoantibodies in autoimmune neurological conditions is evolving, but testing recommendations remain unchanged in Australia with GAD enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblot as the only two Therapeutic Goods Administration approved testing methods available in Australia. Common practice is for use of ELISA in diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and use of immunoblot for diagnosis of GAD65-associated neurological disease. We observed a cohort of patients with negative immunoblot results and positive ELISA in the context of GAD-associated neurological disease without T1DM. In the absence of robust consensus guidelines on preferred testing modalities, we sought to determine if ELISA could have a superior role in the diagnosis of GAD-associated neurological disease when compared to immunoblot in this paper. We tested for anti-GAD65 autoantibodies on 55 patient samples, 40 samples requested for neurological disease and 15 type 1 diabetes samples with detectable anti-GAD65, using two testing platforms: Euroimmun anti-GAD enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and. Euroimmun EuroLine immunoblot for paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes. These results were correlated against the clinical scenario. Positive ELISA results had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 91% for GAD65-related neurological disease. Immunoblot showed sensitivity of 43% and specificity of 76% for GAD65-related neurological disease. ELISA proved more sensitive and specific for GAD65-related neurological disease compared to immunoblot, raising questions about the role of this testing modality in neurological disease. We propose that ELISA should be used as a sole diagnostic method for all GAD65 antibody-related neurological disease over immunoblot. The presence of anti-GAD65 antibody on immunoblot is of doubtful clinical significance. Copyright © 2023 Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical spectrum of stiff-person syndrome (SPS) encompasses a wide range of signs including psychiatric symptoms (PS)., OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to provide an overview of the spectrum of PS in SPS through a systematic literature search and 2 illustrative case reports., METHODS: We reported 2 anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive SPS cases that presented with phobic disorder, and we performed a systematic review by following the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Articles published in PubMed, MEDLINE on Ovid, Embase, and via a manual search before October 20, 2020, were selected by 2 independent reviewers. Original studies, case reports, editorials, commentaries, and letters to the editor reporting cases of SPS with PS were all included. Conference abstracts, reviews and book chapters, unavailable articles, and those not reporting SPS cases or PS were excluded. Quantitative summary data were calculated., RESULTS: In addition to our 2 cases, we identified 237 cases of SPS with PS from 74 additional included publications totaling 239 patients. Anxiety (56%) and depression (45%) were the most common PS in SPS. Mean diagnostic delay was 4.7 years. Among the 3 SPS phenotypes, the classic form was predominant (77%), followed by stiff-limb syndrome (13%) and progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (10%). The most frequent etiology of SPS with PS was autoimmune (90%), followed by cryptogenic (7%) and paraneoplastic forms (7%). These patients were mainly treated with immune-mediated therapies and GABAergic drugs., CONCLUSIONS: Our review revealed that the most common PS of SPS are anxiety and depression occurring mostly in autoimmune and classic forms, allowing a clearer understanding of this entity, which may lead to earlier diagnosis and better outcome.

AB  - Autoimmune neurological syndromes (AINS) with autoantibodies against the 65 kDa isoform of the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) present with limbic encephalitis, including temporal lobe seizures or epilepsy, cerebellitis with ataxia, and stiff-person-syndrome or overlap forms. Anti-GAD65 autoantibodies are also detected in autoimmune diabetes mellitus, which has a strong genetic susceptibility conferred by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and non-HLA genomic regions. We investigated the genetic predisposition in patients with anti-GAD65 AINS. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and an association analysis of the HLA region in a large German cohort of 1214 individuals. These included 167 patients with anti-GAD65 AINS, recruited by the German Network for Research on Autoimmune Encephalitis (GENERATE), and 1047 individuals without neurological or endocrine disease as population-based controls. Predictions of protein expression changes based on GWAS findings were further explored and validated in the CSF proteome of a virtually independent cohort of 10 patients with GAD65-AINS and 10 controls. Our GWAS identified 16 genome-wide significant (P < 5 x 10-8) loci for the susceptibility to anti-GAD65 AINS. The top variant, rs2535288 [P = 4.42 x 10-16, odds ratio (OR) = 0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.187-0.358], localized to an intergenic segment in the middle of the HLA class I region. The great majority of variants in these loci (>90%) mapped to non-coding regions of the genome. Over 40% of the variants have known regulatory functions on the expression of 48 genes in disease relevant cells and tissues, mainly CD4+ T cells and the cerebral cortex. The annotation of epigenomic marks suggested specificity for neural and immune cells. A network analysis of the implicated protein-coding genes highlighted the role of protein kinase C beta (PRKCB) and identified an enrichment of numerous biological pathways participating in immunity and neural function. Analysis of the classical HLA alleles and haplotypes showed no genome-wide significant associations. The strongest associations were found for the DQA1*03:01-DQB1*03:02-DRB1*04:01HLA haplotype (P = 4.39 x 10-4, OR = 2.5, 95%CI = 1.499-4.157) and DRB1*04:01 allele (P = 8.3 x 10-5, OR = 2.4, 95%CI = 1.548-3.682) identified in our cohort. As predicted, the CSF proteome showed differential levels of five proteins (HLA-A/B, C4A, ATG4D and NEO1) of expression quantitative trait loci genes from our GWAS in the CSF proteome of anti-GAD65 AINS. These findings suggest a strong genetic predisposition with direct functional implications for immunity and neural function in anti-GAD65 AINS, mainly conferred by genomic regions outside the classical HLA alleles.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-abs) at high serum levels are associated with diverse autoimmune neurological syndromes (AINS), including cerebellar ataxia, epilepsy, limbic encephalitis and stiff-person syndrome. The impact of low serum GAD-ab levels in patients with suspected AINS remains controversial. Specific intrathecal GAD-ab synthesis may serve as a marker for GAD-ab-associated nervous system autoimmunity. We present characteristics of a multicentric patient cohort with suspected AINS associated with GAD antibodies (SAINS-GAD+) and explore the relevance of serum GAD-ab levels and intrathecal GAD-ab synthesis., METHODS: All patients with SAINS-GAD+ included in the registry of the German Network for Research on Autoimmune Encephalitis (GENERATE) from 2011 to 2019 were analyzed. High serum GAD-ab levels were defined as RIA>2000 U/mL, ELISA>1000 U/mL, or as a positive staining pattern on cell-based assays., RESULTS: One-hundred-one patients were analyzed. In descending order they presented with epilepsy/limbic encephalitis (39%), cerebellar ataxia (28%), stiff person syndrome (22%), and overlap syndrome (12%). Immunotherapy was administered in 89% of cases with improvements in 46%. 35% of SAINS-GAD+ patients had low GAD-ab serum levels. Notably, unmatched oligoclonal bands in CSF but not in serum were more frequent in patients with low GAD-ab serum levels. GAD-ab-levels (high/low) and intrathecal GAD-ab synthesis (present or not) did not impact clinical characteristics and outcome., CONCLUSIONS: Overall, immunotherapy in SAINS-GAD+ was moderately effective. Serum GAD-ab levels and the absence or presence of intrathecal GAD-ab synthesis did not predict clinical characteristics or outcomes in SAINS-GAD+. The detection of unmatched oligoclonal bands might outweigh low GAD-ab serum levels. Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune neurological disorder. Paraneoplastic SPS associated with malignant tumors such as thymoma occurs in approximately 5% of all SPS cases. We present a rare case of thymoma accompanied by SPS successfully treated using surgery., PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 26-year-old woman presented with lower limbs convulsions and gait disturbance and complained of leg pain. Cerebrospinal fluid and blood test results showed a high level of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies. Computed tomography showed anterior mediastinal tumor suggestive of a thymoma. She underwent extended thymectomy, and her symptoms gradually improved after surgery. No evidence of recurrent thymoma and SPS has been observed over 44 months., CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment would be effective for patients with SPS and thymoma.

AB  - PURPOSE: Stiff person syndrome (SPS), an autoimmune disease that manifests with episodic muscle rigidity and spasms, has anesthetic considerations because postoperative hypotonia may occur. This hypotonia has been linked to muscle relaxants and volatile anesthetics and may persist in spite of neostigmine administration and train-of-four (TOF) monitoring suggesting full reversal. We present a patient with SPS who experienced hypotonia following total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), which was promptly reversed with sugammadex. These observations are considered in light of the relevant medical literature., CLINICAL FEATURES: A 46-yr-old female patient with SPS underwent breast lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy. Anesthesia consisted of TIVA (propofol/remifentanil) with adjunctive administration of rocuronium 20 mg to obtain adequate intubating conditions. Despite return of the TOF ratio to 100% within 30 min, hypotonia was clinically evident at conclusion of surgery two hours later. Sugammadex 250 mg reversed residual muscle relaxation permitting uneventful extubation. A literature review identified six instances of postoperative hypotonia (TIVA, n = 3; volatile anesthetics, n = 3) in spite of neostigmine administration (n = 2) and TOF monitoring suggesting full reversal (n = 4)., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SPS may show hypotonia regardless of general anesthetic technique (TIVA vs inhalational anesthesia), which can persist despite recovery of the TOF ratio and may be more effectively reversed by a chelating agent than with an anticholinesterase. If general anesthesia is required, we suggest a cautious approach to administering muscle relaxants including using the smallest dose necessary, considering the importance of clinical assessment of muscle strength recovery in addition to TOF monitoring, and discussing postoperative ventilation risk with the patient prior to surgery.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare, debilitating neurological illness characterised by rigidity and spasms of the axial muscles, causing severe restrictions to mobility. SPS can be classic, partial or paraneoplastic. We report a case of a young woman who presented with seizures and painful spasms of the thoracolumbar muscles who was subsequently diagnosed with SPS. Serological work revealed glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies and imaging showed a large mediastinal mass. The patient underwent surgical resection of the mediastinal mass and final pathology revealed well-differentiated mediastinal liposarcoma. She received five sessions of plasma exchange and her neurological symptoms gradually improved after surgery. This case highlights a rare case of GAD antibody-positive paraneoplastic SPS associated with mediastinal liposarcoma. Copyright © BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2022. No commercial re-use.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ictal piloerection (IP) is a rare manifestation of focal epilepsy. Autoimmune limbic encephalitis (LE) and malignant brain tumours are the most frequent recognized aetiologies., METHODS: We selected all patients diagnosed with LE in our Institute from 2004 to 2020 and manifesting with IP. We performed a literature review on LE patients presenting IP., RESULTS: Of 15 patients diagnosed with LE (13.3%), two manifested IP as prominent ictal feature. One of them also had stiff-limb syndrome. Video-EEG documented ictal discharges from the right temporal regions with concomitant sympathetic skin response (SSR) recording. Antibody testing showed elevated serum and CSF titres of GAD65 antibodies (Ab), in both cases. Despite a combination of several anti-seizure medications and first- and second-line immunotherapy, they showed a poor clinical outcome after 2 and 9 years of follow-up, respectively. The literature review yielded 13 papers reporting 26 LE cases with IP. LGI1 Ab were the most frequently associated (73.1%) followed by VGKC-complex (7.7%), GAD65 (7.7%), NMDAr (3.8%), Ma2 (3.8%) and Hu (3.8%) Ab. Cases with LGI1 Ab showed a good response to immunotherapy., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The prevalence of IP in our LE cohort was of 13.3%, higher than expected. According to the literature review, most cases were associated with LGI1 Ab and showed a good response to immunotherapy. With the contribution of our cases, GAD65 emerged as the second most frequently detected Ab, showing a poor outcome. Our findings widen the spectrum of IP-associated Ab, with the respective prognostic implications. Copyright © 2022. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Importance: Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) refers to a group of neuropsychiatric conditions associated with specific circulating autoantibodies directed against synaptic receptors, neuronal cell surface proteins, and intracellular targets. Increased recognition of these disorders is of value, as affected patients prominently display cognitive impairment, behavioral disturbances, and seizures requiring multidisciplinary teams, with early recognition often impacting prognosis., Observations: This case series is based on a retrospective record review of adult patients diagnosed with AE between January 1, 2010- January 1, 2020. Cases 1 and 2, demonstrating anti- N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis with initial manifestations of neurologic and psychiatric symptoms, correlate with the literature describing a higher prevalence of this condition in young women. Case 3, despite being seronegative, exhibited classic features of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Case 4 demonstrates a classic presentation of anti-leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) encephalitis: a middle-aged male with psychosis, altered mentation, and epilepsy. Case 5 had a more indolent neuropsychiatric presentation with mild elevation of N-type voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC) antibody. Case 6, with glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) antibody, was an elderly female with speech dysfunction and altered mentation, and case 7 was an elderly male with GAD65 antibody who had stiff-person syndrome, ataxia, cognitive decline, and thymoma., Conclusions: This retrospective case series describes the clinical details of 7 individuals with AE and overlapping neuropsychiatric symptoms. This series is limited in scope, with a small number of cases and observational findings, which prevents specific conclusions from being drawn. Despite this limitation, the present article explores the nuances of variable presentations of this disease to inform better interdisciplinary management and emphasize the gap areas that need rigorous research. © Copyright 2022 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare, autoimmune, neurological disorder that often occurs concurrently with other autoimmune disorders, such as type 1 diabetes mellitus, pernicious anaemia, vitiligo and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. It also can manifest as a paraneoplastic syndrome. Although SPS classically presents with truncal and appendicular stiffness and lumbar hyperlordosis, it can present focally in a single limb (termed stiff-limb syndrome). Here, we describe a woman with stiff-limb syndrome who initially presented with concerns about right foot swelling and pain. She also was positive for anti-GAD65 (anti-GAD2) antibodies. With treatment, she regained the ability to drive and ambulate without a walker, and she had a noted reduction in stimulus-induced spasms. Copyright © BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2022.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) is an acute, potentially life-threatening, yet curable neuro-immunological disease characterized by spasms, muscular rigidity, and brainstem and autonomic dysfunction. The clinical features of glycine receptor (GlyR) antibody-positive PERM may be overlooked, particularly with some unusual symptoms., CASE PRESENTATION: A 52-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for evaluation of tension headache for 20 days and mild dysarthria. These symptoms were followed by panic, profuse sweating, severe dysarthria, dizziness, unsteady gait, and paroxysmal muscle spasms. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were normal. The patient's condition steadily deteriorated. He repeatedly presented with rigidity, panic attacks, severe anxiety, paroxysmal inspiratory laryngeal stridor, cyanosis of the lips, and intractable epilepsy. Electromyography showed multiple myoclonic seizures, a single generalized tonic-clonic seizure, and a single generalized tonic seizure. Screening for autoimmune encephalitis antibodies revealed anti-GlyR antibodies in his cerebrospinal fluid. Immunomodulatory pulse therapy with steroids and immunoglobulin resulted in expeditious improvement of the symptoms within 2 weeks, and a follow-up at 5 weeks showed consistent clinical improvement., CONCLUSION: Our case highlights that inspiratory laryngeal stridor is an important symptom of PERM. Our observation widens the spectrum of the clinical presentation of anti-GlyR antibody-positive PERM, where early identification is a key to improving prognosis. Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).

AB  - Antiglutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) encephalitis is rare and few pediatric cases have been reported, with variable clinical presentations. A 14-year-old female adolescent was managed in our department. She had been treated for several months for drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy and gradually presented major anterograde amnesia with confusion. Upon her arrival at the University Hospital Centre, she showed a classical form of stiff person syndrome. The brain magnetic resonance imaging showed bitemporal hyperintensities and hypertrophy of the amygdala. The blood and cerebrospinal fluid were positive for GAD65 antibodies. At 2 years of immunosuppressive treatment and rehabilitation, the course showed partial improvement of the memory and neuropsychiatric impairment, and epilepsy that continued to be active. GAD65 antibodies are associated with various neurological syndromes, and this presentation combining limbic encephalitis and stiff person syndrome is the first pediatric form published to date; there are also few cases described in adults.

AB  - Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) is a severe form of stiff-person spectrum disorder. We report a 59-year-old man who presented with progressive encephalomyelitis causing diplopia, bulbar palsy, severe dysautonomia, followed by stiffness and myoclonic cluster. Laboratory tests showed mild pleocytosis, with markedly elevated plasma levels of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and arginine vasopressin. Glycine-receptor antibodies were identified in both serum and CSF. Despite a poor response to methylprednisolone, immunoglobulins, and plasma exchange, alpha-blocker stabilized dysautonomia. Dysautonomia is presumed to be due to antibody-mediated disinhibited sympathetic hyperactivity; however, this case suggests that concomitant use of alpha-blocker with immunotherapy may ameliorate dysautonomia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Even within the most populous countries in the Middle East, such as Iran, autoimmune encephalitis cases have been rarely reported., OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the demographic, clinical, and paraclinical characteristics of Iranian patients with autoimmune encephalitis positive for anti-neuronal autoantibodies., METHODS: This cross-sectional study included all patients diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis and referred to our hospital, in Isfahan, Iran, from March 2016 to May 2020. Patients' demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and electroencephalographic features were obtained from their medical records., RESULTS: We identified a total of 39 (21 females, 53.8%) patients with autoimmune encephalitis (mean age = 34.9 +/- 12.8 years). The most commonly detected antibody was anti-NMDAR (n = 26, 66.7%), followed by anti-GABABR (n = 8, 20.5%), anti-Zic4 (n = 4, 10.3%), and anti-GAD65 (n = 1, 2.6%) antibodies, in descending order of frequency. Two anti-NMDAR-positive patients had a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and four had a prior history of herpes simplex encephalitis. Clinical presentations in patients positive for anti-Zic4 antibodies included cognitive decline (n = 4, 100%), seizures (n = 3, 75%), parkinsonism (n = 1, 25%), and stiff-person syndrome (n = 1, 25%)., CONCLUSION: This was the first case series of Iranian patients with autoimmune encephalitis with some interesting observations, including SLE-associated anti-NMDAR encephalitis, as well as an unusual concurrence of anti-Zic4 antibody positivity and cognitive problems, seizures, parkinsonism, and stiff-person syndrome.

AB  - Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) is a subtype of stiff-person syndrome (formerly stiff-man syndrome). It is rare and disabling, and characterised by brainstem symptoms, muscle stiffness, breathing issues and autonomic dysfunction. We describe a 65-year-old man who presented with odynophagia together with tongue and neck swelling, followed by multiple cranial nerve palsies culminating in bilateral vocal cord paralysis with acute stridor. He subsequently developed progressive generalised hypertonia and painful limb spasms. Serum antiglycine receptor antibody was strongly positive, but antiglutamic acid decarboxylase and other antibodies relating to stiff-person syndrome were negative. We diagnosed PERM and gave intravenous corticosteroids and immunoglobulins without benefit; however, following plasma exchange he has made a sustained improvement.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore different neurological manifestations with suspicion of being associated to serum glutamate decarboxylase antibodies (GAD-Abs) in order to better characterize anti-GAD neurological syndromes., METHODS: Observational retrospective study including all patients for whom GAD65-Abs titers in serum were requested by the Neurology Department at La Paz University Hospital between 2015 and 2019. GAD-Abs were measured by ELISA. Demographic data, neurological symptoms, comorbidity with diabetes mellitus (DM) or with another autoimmune disease, and GAD-Abs titers were studied. Stiff-person syndrome, ataxia, encephalitis, and epilepsy were considered typical anti-GAD neurological syndromes and were compared to other atypical manifestations., RESULTS: A total of 173 patients (51.7% men, mean age 51.62) were included. A progressive increase in requests of serum GAD-Abs has occurred over the last 5 years, especially in patients with atypical neurological manifestations. GAD-Abs were found in the serum of 22 patients (12.7%); of those, 15 (68.18%) suffered a typical anti-GAD syndrome. Presence of DM or another organ-specific autoimmune disease was predictive of GAD-AB seropositivity (p < 0.001). 6.6% of requested patients with an atypical syndrome had GAD-Abs, but serum levels were significantly lower than those found in patients with a typical syndrome (706.67 vs 1430.23 UI/mL; Mann-Whitney U, p = 0.034), and were finally diagnosed with another neurological disease., CONCLUSION: Serum GAD-Abs were infrequently found in patients with clinical phenotypes other than those classically described as anti-GAD disorders, and with very low titers. In typical anti-GAD syndromes, there is a high comorbidity with DM and with other autoimmune diseases, and high serum GAD-Abs levels are usually present. Copyright © 2021.

AB  - Neurological disorders associated with anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) autoimmunity are rare and include a variety of neurological syndromes: stiff-person syndrome, cerebellar ataxia or limbic encephalitis. The diagnosis remains challenging due to the variety of symptoms and normal brain imaging. The morphological MRI of 26 patients (T1-weighted and Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)-weighted images) was analyzed at the initial stage of diagnosis, matched by age and sex to 26 healthy subjects. We performed a vertex-wise analysis using a generalized linear model, adjusting by age, to compare the brain cortical thickness of both populations. In addition, we used a voxel-based morphometry of cerebellum thickness obtained by CEREbellum Segmentation (CERES), as well as the hippocampus volumetry comparison using HIPpocampus subfield Segmentation (HIPS). Finally, we extracted 62 radiomics features using LifeX to assess the classification performance using a random forest model to identify an anti-GAD related MRI. The results suggest a peculiar profile of atrophy in patients with anti-GAD, with a significant atrophy in the temporal and frontal lobes (adjusted p-value < 0.05), and a focal cerebellar atrophy of the V-lobule, independently of the anti-GAD phenotype. Finally, the MRIs from anti-GAD patients were correctly classified when compared to the control group, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98. This study suggests a particular pattern of cortical atrophy throughout all anti-GAD phenotypes. These results reinforce the notion that the different neurological anti-GAD phenotypes should be considered as a continuum due to their similar cortical thickness profiles.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) is a rare disorder. However, the outcome is still variable with different serological and tumor associations, and the elements to good response with less relapse is yet to be elucidated., METHOD: We present a case and obtain a literature review of patients with PERM and make comparisons based on different serological groups. We also analyze patients with idiopathic PERM that had detailed medical records., RESULTS: 81 patients were collected and analyzed. The largest group were glycine receptor-antibody (GlyR-Ab)-positive (70%), and the seropositive-GlyR-Ab-negative group had better response to immunotherapy. Malignancy can occur up to 2 years from the presentation of PERM. Among the 18 cases with detailed records, the patients who had good outcome initiate immunotherapy within 2 months from presentation. 9 of the 12 patients who experienced no relapse had non-steroid immunotherapy. The maximal interval time of relapse was 24 months., CONCLUSION: We recommend tumor surveillance up to 2 years in patients with PERM and early administration of immunotherapies and maintain with non-steroid immunotherapy with or without oral corticosteroid for a minimum of 2 years to reduce the risk of relapse in GlyR-Ab-positive patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report the clinical, neuroimaging, and antibody associations in patients with autoimmune encephalitis (AE) and thymoma., METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 43 patients was conducted. Antibody determination and immunoprecipitation to characterize novel antigens were performed using reported techniques., RESULTS: Patients' median age was 52 years (range: 23-88 years). Forty (93%) had neuronal surface antibodies: gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor A (GABAAR) (15), amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) (13), contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2) (4), leucine-rich, glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1) (3), glycine receptor (GlyR) (3), and unknown antigens (2). Concurrent antibodies against intracellular antigens occurred in 13 (30%; 9 anti-collapsin response mediator protein 5 [CRMP5]) and were more frequent in anti-AMPAR encephalitis (54% vs 20%; p = 0.037). The most common clinical presentation was encephalitis with multiple T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintense lesions in 23 (53%) patients (15 GABAAR, 5 AMPAR, and 1 unknown neuropil antibody), followed by encephalitis with peripheral nerve hyperexcitability in 7 (16%; 4 CASPR2, 2 LGI1, and 1 unknown antibody), limbic encephalitis in 6 (14%; 4 AMPAR, 1 LGI1, and 1 antibody negative), progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus in 4 (9%; 3 GlyR and 1 AMPAR antibodies), and encephalitis with normal MRI in 3 (7%; AMPAR antibodies). Anti-GABAAR encephalitis was more prevalent in Japanese patients compared with Caucasians and other ethnicities (61% vs 16%; p = 0.003). In anti-AMPAR encephalitis, 3/4 patients with poor and 0/6 with good outcome had concurrent CRMP5 antibodies (p = 0.033). Immunoprecipitation studies identified metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 antibodies that were additionally found in 5 patients (3 with and 2 without encephalitis)., CONCLUSIONS: AE in patients with thymoma include several clinical-radiologic syndromes that vary according to the associated antibodies. Anti-GABAAR encephalitis was the most frequent AE and occurred more frequently in Japanese patients. Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Antiglutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)-associated neurologic disorders are rare, with varied presentations, including stiff-person syndrome (SPS) and cerebellar ataxia (CA). Vestibular and ocular motor (VOM) dysfunction can be the main presentation in a subset of patients., METHODS: Retrospective review of the Johns Hopkins Hospital medical records from 1997 to 2018 identified a total of 22 patients with a diagnosis of anti-GAD-associated SPS or CA who had detailed VOM assessments. Eight had prominent VOM dysfunction at the initial symptom onset and were referred to neurology from ophthalmology or otolaryngology ("early dominant"). Fourteen patients had VOM dysfunction that was not their dominant presentation and were referred later in their disease course from neurology to neuro-ophthalmology ("nondominant"). We reviewed clinical history, immunological profiles, and VOM findings, including available video-oculography., RESULTS: In the 8 patients with early dominant VOM dysfunction, the average age of symptom onset was 53 years, and 5 were men. The most common symptom was dizziness, followed by diplopia. Seven had features of CA, and 4 had additional features of SPS. None had a structural lesion on brain MRI accounting for their symptoms. The most common VOM abnormalities were downbeating and gaze-evoked nystagmus and saccadic pursuit. All received immune therapy and most received symptomatic therapy. Most experienced improvement in clinical outcome measures (modified Rankin scale and/or timed 25-foot walk test) or VOM function. By contrast, in the 14 patients in whom VOM dysfunction was nondominant, most had an SPS phenotype and were women. VOM abnormalities, when present, were more subtle, although mostly still consistent with cerebellar and/or brainstem dysfunction., CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with anti-GAD-associated neurologic disorders may present with prominent VOM abnormalities at the initial symptom onset that localize to the cerebellum and/or brainstem. In our cohort, immune and symptomatic therapies improved clinical outcomes and symptomatology. Copyright © 2020 by North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society.

AB  - The aim of the present report is to show the effects of a clinical pilates-based physiotherapy training program on physical functioning, including balance ability, flexibility, muscle strength, and pain severity in a case with Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS). A 43-year-old female with a 3-year history of SPS participated in the study. Clinical pilates training exercises were performed two times per week during 8 weeks. Static balance was evaluated with One Leg Stance Test and Tandem Stance Test, dynamic balance with Functional Reach Test and lower extremity strength and endurance measured by 30-s Chair Stand Test. Berg Balance Scale was used to assess balance and fall risk, and Timed Up and Go Test was used to assess functional mobility. Pain evaluation was done by Pain Quality Assessment Scale. Flexibility was measured with tape measure, range of motion with goniometer and muscle strength with manual muscle test. Among the balance and functional mobility tests, progress has been observed in all tests, except for 30-s Chair Stand test. Improvements have been observed in patient's range of motion, flexibility, strength, pain and balance parameters. Clinical pilates-based physiotherapy program had positive effects on many physical and functional parameters of the patient and can be used as a safe exercise method in physiotherapy rehabilitation of SPS.

AB  - A prompt diagnosis and treatment of patients with autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (CA) with antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-Abs) may lead to a better prognosis. Herein, we report prodromal transient neurological symptoms that should raise clinical suspicion of CA with GAD-Abs. We initially identified a 70-year-old man who presented a first acute episode of vertigo, diplopia, and ataxia lasting 2 weeks. Two months later, he experienced a similar episode along with new-onset gaze-evoked nystagmus. After 4 months, downbeat nystagmus, left limb dysmetria, and gait ataxia progressively appeared, and an autoimmune CA was diagnosed based on the positivity of GAD-Abs in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We searched retrospectively for similar presentations in a cohort of 31 patients diagnosed with CA and GAD-Abs. We found 11 (35.4%) patients (all women, median age 62 years; 8/11 [72.7%] with autoimmune comorbidities) with transient neurological symptoms antedating CA onset by a median of 3 months, including vertigo in 9 (81.8%; described as paroxysmal in 8) and fluctuating diplopia in 3 (27.3%) patients. The identification of transient neurological symptoms of unknown etiology, such as paroxysmal vertigo and fluctuating diplopia, should lead to GAD-Abs testing in serum and CSF, especially in patients with autoimmune comorbidities.

AB  - Background: Paraneoplastic stiff-limb syndrome (SLS) is a rare manifestation of underlying malignancy and could have distinctive features different from the classic stiff-person syndrome (SPS).Case Description: We present a case of anti-amphiphysin antibody (Ab)-associated paraneoplastic SLS, in an 83-year-old woman with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. She presented with stiffness, painful spasms of the distal legs, and asymmetrical fixed posturing of the foot. There are coexisting long-tract disturbance and lower-extremity weakness. Treatment with diazepam provided symptomatic relief while plasma exchange (PLEX) did not lead to significant clinical improvement. The patient was bedridden within 3 months and passed away within 6 months from symptom onset.Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of recognition of uncommon presentation of SPS and its oncological significance. This entity requires a high degree of suspicion for initiation of the proper workup. The rapid identification and treatment of the underlying tumor might offer the best chance for recovery.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare disorder with an estimated prevalence in the general population of 1-2 cases/1,000,000. It is 2-3 times more common in females, with symptom onset at the age of 20-50 years in most cases. Although stiff-person syndrome is associated with antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase and amphiphysin, their presence is not necessary for the diagnosis. The treatment should be multidirectional and include immunomodulation, symptomatic treatment as well as monitoring and treatment of overlapping autoimmune, and surgery. We present a case report of a patient diagnosed with stiff-person syndrome overlapping with axonal and demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy. The diagnostic workup indicated diabetes-related polyneuropathy. About 30% of patients diagnosed with stiff-person syndrome also have diabetes. Polyneuropathy alone is rarely reported to overlap with the disorder. In our opinion, polyneuropathy may have a beneficial effect on the clinical presentation of stiff-person syndrome.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS), also known as Stiff-man syndrome/Moersch-Woltman syndrome, is a rare disorder of the central nervous system, first described in 1956, characterized by rigidity and stimulus -triggered painful muscle spasms of predominantly axial and proximal limb muscles. There are many variants of SPS; these include the classical SPS, stiff leg syndrome, and paraneoplastic variant. The paraneoplastic variant of SPS is more common in patients with breast cancer with anti-amphiphysin antibodies, followed by colon carcinoma, lung carcinomas, thymoma, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. A possible autoimmune origin for the disease has been proposed, including antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase and amphiphysin. We thus describe a case of anti-amphiphysin antibody-positive SPS, which initially manifested with generalized pruritus. After extensive investigations and removing her underlying tumor, she reported complete recovery of her symptoms.

AB  - Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) is a relapsing-remitting neurological disorder that falls within the stiff person syndrome-spectrum disorders. We report a 16-year-old girl with PERM associated with an anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody. She had an aggressive initial presentation mimicking fulminant septic shock, followed by truncal and lower limb rigidity, stimulus-sensitive spasm, cognitive impairment, brainstem signs (hyperekplexia, nystagmus), and dysautonomia (urinary retention, constipation, facial flushing, blood pressure fluctuation). Cerebrospinal fluid, electroencephalography, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine showed features suggestive autoimmune encephalitis and myelitis. The serum anti-GAD antibody was positive, and the diagnosis of PERM was made. She had fluctuating clinical response despite intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, plasmapheresis, and symptomatic medications. Eventually, in the fourth month since admission, she showed gradual and persistent clinical improvement after introducing rituximab. She was discharged after 6 months of hospitalization, and no relapse was observed in the first 3 years of follow-up.PERM is a rare and underrecognized condition in children. Contrary to previous reports, our case describes an aggressive and life-threatening presentation for PERM. Vague symptoms and the lack of gold diagnostic tests hinder a timely diagnosis. Our study also highlights the need for developing standardized diagnostic criteria and consensus in managing PERM.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare disease affecting the central nervous system which can be autoimmune, paraneoplastic or idiopathic in origin. Its typical classic presentation is characterized by progressive stiffness of the trunk and limbs, associated with spasms. The diagnosis is supported by the existence of continuous and spontaneous muscle activity on electroneuromyogrom detection, the presence of serum anti-GAD antibodies, and a response to benzodiazepines. We report the case of a 46-year-old patient with a classic form of autoimmune stiff person syndrome associated with dermatitis herpetiformis.

AB  - BackgroundProgressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) is a subtype of stiff-person syndrome, a rare cerebrospinal disease that causes brainstem symptoms, myoclonus, muscle rigidity, and hyperekplexia. Case presentationA 71-year-old man experienced left-sided stiff face, and was subsequently admitted to our hospital because of the appearance of left-dominant lower limb myoclonus. Muscle rigidity followed 3 days later. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed no abnormality. An electrophysiological examination showed a toughness of the antagonistic muscle following evocation of the Achilles tendon reflex, and a tonic phenomenon affecting the left facial muscles during the blink reflex. The patient's serum was positive for anti-glycine receptor (anti-GlyR) antibody, suggesting PERM. The patient was administered steroids, immunoglobulin therapy, and immunosuppressive drugs. He gradually improved after these therapies and became able to walk using a walker. ConclusionsWe conclude that this was a rare case of anti-GlyR antibody-positive PERM with unilateral brainstem symptoms, myoclonus, and muscle rigidity.

AB  - Approximately half of patients with stiff person syndrome experienced dyspnea due to the involvement of the respiratory muscles. If these muscles are severely affected, respiratory failure can occur. Here, we describe a patient with stiff person syndrome whose nighttime dyspnea was successfully controlled by noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV). A 38-year-old female patient visited the emergency room due to nighttime dyspnea. Her O-2 saturation was 93%, and PaCO2 increased to 53.4 mmHg on arterial blood gas analysis. No specific lesion was found on the chest radiograph. We considered that her dyspnea was caused by respiratory muscle stiffness following SPS. For the management of nighttime hypercapnia, we applied NIPPV with volume-targeted assist-control ventilation mode using an oronasal mask interface during sleep. After such treatment, PaCO2 was normalized, and nighttime dyspnea disappeared. We think that NIPPV would be a useful therapeutic option for managing dyspnca induced by stiff person syndrome.

AB  - Importance: Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus is characterized by rigidity, painful muscle spasms, hyperekplexia, and brainstem signs. Recently, glycine receptor alpha 1 antibodies have been described in adult patients with progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus. We describe a pediatric case.Observations: A 14-month-old child developed startle-induced episodes of generalized rigidity and myoclonus, axial hyperextension, and trismus, without impairment of consciousness. Episodes occurred during wakefulness and sleep, lasted seconds, and were accompanied by moaning, tachypnea, and oxygen desaturation. Imaging, cerebrospinal fluid, endocrine, metabolic, and genetic screening findings were normal or negative. She was treated with intravenous steroids and immunoglobulins with resolution of symptoms, but she relapsed weeks later. At this time, episodes were more severe. Glycine receptor alpha 1 antibodies were found in serum (titer of 1:200, later 1:320) and cerebrospinal fluid (titer of 1:2). Treatment was restarted with intravenous steroids and immunoglobulins, with major improvement, and she began treatment with oral steroids. She had 4 milder relapses, with improvement after treatment adjustments.Conclusions and Relevance: To our knowledge, this is the first pediatric case of progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus associated with glycine receptor alpha 1 antibodies, a potentially severe but treatable antibody-mediated neurological disorder.

AB  - Background. The stiff-man syndrome is a rare disease of the central nervous system characterized by progressive rigidity of the body musculature. Autoantibodies directed against glutamic acid decarboxylase are present in about 60 percent of patients with the syndrome. in this group, there is a striking association of the stiff-man syndrome with organ-specific autoimmune diseases, primarily insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.Methods. We studied three women with the stiff-man syndrome and breast cancer, seeking autoantibodies directed against nervous system antigens in serum and cerebrospinal fluid by immunocytochemical techniques, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation.Results. Autoantibodies directed against a 128-kd brain protein were found in two of the women with the stiff-man syndrome and breast cancer. These results led to a search for breast cancer in the third patient with the stiff-man syndrome, who also had autoantibodies. A small invasive ductal carcinoma was detected by ultrasonography and removed. Serum samples from all three patients were negative for autoantibodies directed against glutamic acid decarboxylase. Autoantibodies against the 128-kd antigen were not detected in control patients with the stiff-man syndrome without breast cancer or in patients with cancer who did not have the syndrome. Within the nervous system, the 128-kd autoantigen was localized in neurons and concentrated at synapses.Conclusions. In a subgroup of patients with the stiff-man syndrome, the condition is likely to have an autoimmune paraneoplastic origin. The detection of autoantibodies against the 128-kd antigen in patients with this syndrome should be considered an indication to search for an occult breast cancer.

AB  - Stiff-man syndrome is a well-described, but rare and often overlooked, neuromuscular syndrome of rigidity, spasm, and gait abnormality that is associated with several endocrinologic and autoimmune disorders. A patient exhibiting many typical features of stiff-man syndrome had intermittent symptoms for 22 years before the correct diagnosis was made. Similar to many described patients, she was diabetic, hyperthyroid, and had elevated islet cell, antithyroid, and glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody levels. The high frequency of diabetes mellitus among patients with stiff-man syndrome is emphasized, as is increasing evidence to suggest that elaboration of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase and anti-islet cell antibodies may play a role in the pathophysiologic state of the disorder.

AU  - BRASHEAR, HR

PD  - 
AB  - Stiff-man syndrome is a rare disorder of unknown etiology in which progressive rigidity, spasms, and continuous motor unit activity may be due to dysfunction of GABAergic inhibition of alpha motor neurons. Some patients with this disorder have evidence of autoantibodies reactive with glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). We describe a patient with progressive stiff-man syndrome and high titers of GAD-like immunoreactivity in serum but not spinal fluid. Plasmapheresis resulted in lowered antibody titers, decreased exteroceptive reflex responses, reduced motor unit activity, and marked clinical improvement. Immunohistochemistry using patient serum and plasma produced specific labeling of human and experimental animal tissue consistent with GABAergic neurons and terminal fields. This antibody response was not present in samples from more than 200 other patients. These results provide additional evidence of an autoimmune mechanism for stiff-man syndrome and indicate plasmapheresis may be beneficial in some patients.

In anti-GAD65-related neurologic disorder, malignancy screening is often performed with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT). Here, we present an interesting image of 18FFDG PET/CT whole body showing muscle uptake and FDG brain showing thalamic hypometabolism in SPS.

AU  - Bacorro, EA

PY  - 2010
PD  - 
AB  - Stiff-person syndrome is a rare neurologic disorder characterized by fluctuating and progressive stiffness of axial and limb musculature. The high prevalence of autoantibodies and associated autoimmune diseases in patients with stiff person syndrome suggests that it may have an autoimmune etiology. We report a case of a 62-year-old man with diabetes who developed progressive stiffness of the hips and legs and elevated levels of antibody to glutamic acid decarboxylase. He had a partial response to both baclofen and diazepam, but could not tolerate the treatment because of somnolence. He eventually received 2 infusions of rituximab 1000 mg a week apart. The baclofen was discontinued and the diazepam was tapered. However, 6 months after the rituximab treatment, despite continued clinical improvement the patient had persistently elevated titers of antibody to glutamic acid decarboxylase. We postulate that rituximab was associated with clinical improvement through mechanisms other than antibody depletion.

AB  - We studied the EMG response to loud noise in eight patients with stiff-man syndrome (SMS). Audiogenic muscle jerks originated in the acoustic startle reflex. Patients demonstrated excessive, poorly habituating motor activity predominately in axial and leg muscles. Exaggerated startle in SMS probably reflects segmental hyperexcitability of axial and lumbar spinal motor neurons.

AB  - Background: Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) manifests by progressive rigidity along with muscle spasms that affect the axial and limb muscles. First discovered in 1956, significant progress has been made in its clinical characterization, comprehension of pathogenesis, as well as effective treatment therapy. Case presentation: A 67-year old female patient presented with a 2-year history of progressive stiffness along with painful spasms in both legs, with her condition worsening over the previous year making it considerably difficult for her to stand and walk. Here, we report a Stiff-person syndrome patient (SPS) with lung adenocarcinoma who was positive for anti-glutamate decarboxylase (anti-GAD) antibodies. Treatment with hormones and gamma-globulin improved her symptoms. In addition, we present a literature review of SPS patients with tumors. Conclusions: The diagnosis of autoimmune SPS was on the basis of clinical, electrophysiological, as well as immunological findings. Early SPS detection is critical to preventing long-term disability.

TI  - Stiff Person Syndrome <i>Presentation of a Case With Repetitive Complex Discharges in Electromiograms</i>
AU  - Caballero, PEJ
PY  - 2009
PD  - 
AB  - Introduction: Stiff person syndrome is characterized by rigidity of axial and proximal limb muscles, associated with muscle spasms, triggered by unexpected acoustic or somesthetic stimuli. It usually has an autoimmune basis, in which the blood contains antiglutamate decarboxylase antibodies, and is associated with different types of autoimmune diseases. The electromyogram provides evidences of continuous muscular activity.Case Report: A 41-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, Hashimoto thyroiditis, vitiligo, and pernicious anemia developed symptoms compatible with stiff person syndrome. In the electromyogram, in addition to continuous Muscular activity, there was evidence of complex repetitive activity in the form of doublets and triplets.Conclusions: Given the absence of clinical or electrophysiological neuropathic affectation, the presence of doublets and triplets in our patient could be due to a subclinical functional alteration of alpha motoneurons. They could produce the complex repetitive discharges when released from the inhibition mediated by GABAergic neurons.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is characterized by rigidity of truncal and proximal muscles. The presence of abdominal and paraspinal rigidity is a defining clinical feature of SPS. It is rarely associated with the lower motor neuron (LMN) features. We report a patient with SPS whose initial clinical presentation was that of brachial monomelic amyotrophy (BMA). A 24-year-old gentleman presented with a history of the left upper limb wasting and weakness. In addition, he reported stiffness of the lower limbs and abdomen while walking. On examination, patient had left upper limb monomelic amyotrophy and hypertonia, exaggerated deep tendon reflexes in all four limbs. He also had abdominal and paraspinal rigidity. Serum was strongly positive for GAD 65 antibodies suggestive of SPS. Patient showed dramatic improvement to immunomodulation. Patient presented with features of BMA. Symptoms related to SPS were mild. Abdominal rigidity was the clue to the diagnosis. LMN features have been reported previously in stiff person plus syndrome with an atypical course and progressive encephalomyelitis with myoclonus and rigidity, but not in classical SPS.

AB  - A case of stiff-man syndrome (SMS), a rare and dramatic CNS disease characterized by continuous muscle activity and painful spasms resembling a chronic form of tetanus, occurring in a patient with Hodgkin's disease (HD) is reported.  The patient developed the clinical features of SMS at the same time as the HD relapse.  A satisfactory improvement was obtained with diazepam, but the complete recovery from the stiffness was achieved only after chemotherapy was started.  Cerebellar autoantibodies were found in the serum of the patient.  With chemotherapy the patient achieved a second complete remission (CR).  Eighteen months later the patient developed a second HD relapse, and at that time no signs of SMS were detected.

Her CSF contained oligoclonal bands and both her serum and CSF contained antibodies directed against GABA-ergic synapses (anti-glutamic acid dehydrogenase antibodies). These antibodies have recently been described in cases of stiff man syndrome. Both disorders may be part of a clinical spectrum that has an underlying autoimmune basis.

AB  - Stiff-man syndrome (SMS) is a rare disorder of the central nervous system characterized by painful involuntary stiffening of axial muscles accompanied by spasms. These are often precipitated by tactile or emotional stimuli, volitional movement, and startling noises. Until recently, little has been known about the pathogenesis of SMS. There is evidence now to support the hypothesis that SMS may be an autoimmune disease. This is leading to changes in the way this disease is diagnosed and treated. We describe two patients with SMS and review the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment.

AB  - Stiff person syndrome is a rare autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that manifests as stiff-ness and painful spasms of the trunk axis and lower limb muscles. Benzodiazepines are the first choice for the clinical treatment of the disease. We reported a case of SPS. The patient presented with stiffness and convulsions of lower limbs, weakness after convulsions, falling off easily, abdominal muscle stiffness, and painful spasms lasting for several minutes and alleviating spontaneously. This was caused or aggravated by fatigue or mental stimulation. Left stiffness and weakness of the muscle after relief was present. A chest-enhanced computed tomography scan (CT) suggested two large ground glass nodules in the upper lobe of the left lung. Biopsy pathology indicated the nod-ules as adenocarcinoma in situ. The patient's symptoms were significantly relieved after treatment with clonazepam and diazepam combined with pregabalin. The clinical manifestations of SPS vary among patients. The symptoms of the disease are mild or severe. Early identification and treatment can improve the prognoses of these patients.

AB  - Two women with typical stiff-man syndrome (SMS) developed increasingly frequent attacks of muscle spasms with severe paroxysmal autonomic dysfunctions such as transient hyperpyrexia, diaphoresis, tachypnea, tachycardia, pupillary dilation, and arterial hypertension.  Autoantibodies to GABA-ergic neurons were identified in the serum of both patients and in the cerebrospinal fluid of one.  Both died suddenly and unexpectedly.  General autopsy did not reveal the cause of death.  Neuropathological studies revealed perivascular gliosis in the spinal cord and brain stem of one patient and lymphocytic perivascular infiltration in the spinal cord, brain stem, and basal ganglia of the other.  The occurrence of a chronic inflammatory reaction in one of the two patients supports the idea that an autoimmune disease against GABA-ergic neurons may be involved in SMS.  A review of the literature indicates that functional impairment in SMS is severe and prognosis is unpredictable because of the potential for sudden and unexpected death.  Both muscular abnormalities and autonomic dysfunctions may result from autoimmunity directed against GABA-ergic neurons.

AB  - Anti-GAD ataxia is one of the most common forms of immune-mediated cerebellar ataxias. Many neurological syndromes have been reported in association with anti-GAD. Ophthalmoparesis has been described in stiff person syndrome. We report a case of anti-GAD ataxia presenting initially with isolated ophthalmoplegia and showing complete resolution after immunotherapy. A 26-year-old male patient presented with ophthalmoparesis characterized by tonic upwards deviation of the right eye. In the following month, he developed progressive ataxia with anti-GAD titers of 1972 UI/mL. After treatment with methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin, there was complete resolution of symptoms and anti-GAD titers decreased. This is the first report of isolated ophthalmoparesis due to tonic eye deviation associated with anti-GAD antibodies without stiff-person syndrome. Tonic eye deviation has been reported in SPS, possibly secondary to continuous discharge in gaze holding neurons in the brainstem (similar to what occurs in spinal motor neurons). With growing evidence for ocular abnormalitites in SPS, anti-GAD associated neurological syndromes should be included in the differential diagnosis of isolated ophthalmoplegia.

AB  - An emerging body of evidence suggests that changes in cognitive and emotional function are common aspects of stiff person spectrum disorders (SPSD). We sought to examine the pattern of cognitive impairment and psychiatric symptoms in SPSD. MethodsA retrospective review of medical records was conducted for patients seen at the Johns Hopkins Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) center from 1997 to January 1st, 2020. Individuals who had received formal cognitive testing as part of routine clinical care for patient-reported cognitive changes were included. Demographics, prevalence of cognitive impairment, psychoactive medication use, and clinically significant psychiatric symptoms were described. ResultsOut of 205 patients screened, 20 completed cognitive testing (75% female, mean age 47.4 years). The most common domains of impairment were verbal learning and recall memory (n = 14, 70%), verbal fluency (n = 10, 50%), processing speed (n = 8, 40%), and attention (n = 8, 40%). 9/11 patients assessed for depression reported clinically significant symptoms, and 4/9 patients assessed for anxiety reported clinically significant symptoms. ConclusionsScreening for cognitive impairment in SPSD should utilize testing that assesses verbal learning and recall, phonemic verbal fluency, attention, and processing speed. Moreover, it is important to evaluate for co-existing depression and anxiety symptoms, as these are common in SPSD.

AB  - Two-thirds of stiff-man syndrome (SMS) patients harbor an autoantibody specific for a 64-kD species of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the rate-limiting enzyme in GABA synthesis. We assayed SMS antisera from two patients with SMS for the presence of anti-GAD antibodies using Western blot, immunohistochemical, and enzymatic analyses. Both SMS antisera recognized an 80-kD antigen present in human and rat neuronal extracts, and failed to recognize the 64-kD GAD species. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated neuronal binding identical to that reported with anti-GAD antibodies. Both sera depleted GAD activity from brain extracts. Our analysis indicates that these SMS antisera differ from previously reported SMS antisera by recognizing a novel 80-kD antigen, and suggests that they contain antibodies directed against either a species of GAD different in size from the 64-kD enzyme, or a protein that co-immunoprecipitates with GAD.

AB  - Stiff-man syndrome (SMS) is a rare autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system associated with autoantibodies to glutamate decarboxylase (GAD). We isolated five brain-reactive human monoclonal antibodies, with reactivity distinct from GAD, from peripheral blood of a patient newly diagnosed with SMS. Two antibodies reacted with both Purkinje cells and ependymal cells, and precipitated an 80-kDa protein from rat neuronal primary cultures, which was also recognized by 12% (3/25) of SMS sera and 13% (2/15) of SMS cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. The corresponding antigen was identified as 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 4 and may represent a possible novel target of autoimmunity in SMS. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Introduction The effect of stiff person syndrome spectrum disorders (SPSD) on the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is unknown. This case series aims to characterize the prevalence and types of GI dysfunction in individuals with SPSD.Methods A retrospective chart review included individuals diagnosed with SPSD with descriptors of GI symptoms in their medical records. SPSD phenotypes, type of motility test performed, and dysmotility pattern (upper, lower, or diffuse) were assessed. Descriptive statistics and univariate chi-square analyses were utilized.Results Of 240 individuals with SPSD, 32% reported GI symptoms, most were female (83.1%), and white (74%), with a median age at time of GI symptom onset of 50 +/- 13 years. Most common symptoms reported were dysphagia (45%), constipation (40%), and nausea/vomiting (23%). Most individuals had classic SPS (47%) followed by SPS-plus (29%) and 82.9% were positive for serum antiGAD65 antibodies. Of 36 patients that underwent at least one GI motility test, 26 had evidence of upper, lower, or diffuse GI dysmotility (44.4%, 17%, and 4%, respectively). The group who did not undergo testing had a higher proportion of patients with DM.Discussion There is a high prevalence of GI symptoms and transit abnormalities in patients with SPSD. Future prospective, longitudinal studies are warranted to further assess GI symptoms in the context of SPSD and to determine if individuals with GI symptoms differ in prognosis or treatment response from those without GI symptoms. In the meantime, there should be a low threshold for motility testing in patients with SPSD.

AB  - We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intrathecal baclofen (ITB) in stiff-man syndrome. Three patients, unresponsive to current therapy, received 50 mu g of ITB or placebo on sequential days. Following ITB, all patients demonstrated improvement in reflex EMG activity. The mean reduction in total EMG activity (from all muscles) following stimulation of the medial plantar nerve (cutaneous flexor reflex) was 72% following 50 mu g of ITB compared with 18% following placebo (ANOVA: significance of F, p < 0.0001). The mean latency to onset of the response was also significantly prolonged for all muscles following ITB (ANOVA: significance of F,p < 0.05). Although reflex EMG activity was reduced in all patients, clinical improvement was evident in only one patient, who differed from the others studied by a longer duration of disease, greater severity of stiffness, less fear of falling, and greater electrophysiologic improvement.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare progressive neurologic disease associated with autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase, an intracellular enzyme involved in the production of gamma-aminobutyric acid.We present a case involving a 35-year-old Haitian female who was placed under the Baker Act in the emergency department for suicidal behavior and acute psychosis. She has a history of SPS with a positive glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody, a condition most commonly found in females between 20 and 50 years of age. The condition was managed by an outpatient neurologist using diazepam, baclofen, and monthly intravenous immunoglobulin treatments. She also has an extensive history of organic neurological conditions, including traumatic brain injury at 18 years old and COVID-19-related anoxic encephalitis that occurred in December 2020. Both psychiatric and neurological physical exams were completed. They revealed a cerebellar tremor, bilateral ptosis, poor eye contact, decreased concentration, poor insight, depressed mood, flat affect, poor judgement, delusional thoughts and a disorganized thought process with tangential speech. CT and MRI imaging of the brain showed no acute intracranial abnormalities. A quantitative titer of the GAD antibody was completed and shown to be elevated >250IU/mL. Depakote 500mg twice daily and risperidone 3mg twice daily were prescribed. The patient had progressive improvement of psychosis including delusional thoughts over the following five days and was able to be discharged with instructions to follow-up with outpatient neurology.

AB  - Antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) have been predominantly associated with stiff-person syndrome (SPS), which is often accompanied by organ-specific autoimmune diseases, such as late-onset type 1 diabetes. Autoimmune retinal pathology in SPS has recently been suggested to coexist in patients suffering from this disease; however, evidence reporting potential treatment options for the neurological and visual symptoms these patients experience remains scarce. We provide a review of the relevant literature, presenting a rare case of a middle-aged woman with autoimmune retinopathy (AIR) followed by stiff-leg syndrome who responded to intravenous immune globulin treatment (IVIg). Our report adds to previously reported data supporting the efficacy of IVIg in SPS spectrum disorders while also proposing the potential effect of IVIg in treating SPS spectrum patients with coexisting AIR.

AB  - Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune disorder associated with antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-Ab), the key enzyme in gamma-aminobutyric acid synthesis (GABA). In order to investigate the role of cerebral benzodiazepine-receptor binding in SPS, we performed [C-11]flumazenil (FMZ) positron emission tomography (PET) in a female patient with SPS compared to nine healthy controls. FMZ is a radioligand to the postsynaptic central benzodiazepine receptor which is co-localized with the GABA-A receptor. In the SPS patient, we found a global reduction of cortical FMZ binding. In addition, distinct local clusters of reduced radiotracer binding were observed. These data provide first in vivo evidence for a reduced postsynaptic GABA-A receptor availability which may reflect the loss of GABAergic neuronal inhibition in SPS.

AB  - Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune neurological disorder characterized by high titers of antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) causing impaired GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission. To date, there is not a defined therapy for such condition, but immunomodulating therapies, such as plasma exchange, intravenous immunoglobulins, and rituximab, have been widely used in clinical practice. However, the efficacy and tolerability of these treatments is not well established. Efgartigimod, a new neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker, is a human IgG1 antibody Fc fragment engineered with increased affinity for FcRn binding, leading to a reduction in IgGs levels, including pathogenic IgG autoantibody showing promising results in neurological autoimmune disorders and has been approved for the treatment of AChR-seropositive generalized myasthenia gravis (MG). In this study, we report and describe the first data on treatment with efgartigimod in three patients affected by both AChR-seropositive generalized MG and anti-GAD-seropositive SPS. Patients were followed since the start of efgartigimod and for the whole treatment period (12 weeks). MG symptoms were assessed with the "MG activity of daily living score" and the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis score, while SPS ones were assessed with the "SPS activity of daily living score"; muscle strength was assessed with the Medical Research Council Sum score; the overall disability from MG and SPS was assessed by the modified Rankin Scale. All patients showed an improvement in symptoms of both SPS and MG after 2 cycles of treatment. Our data suggest that efgartigimod may be considered as a candidate drug for SPS and other autoantibody-mediated neurological disorders.

AB  - Introduction: Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) is a severe form of stiff-person spectrum disorder characterized by painful spasms, myoclonic jerks, hyperekplexia, brainstem dysfunction, and dysautonomia, which is sometimes resistant to gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA)-ergic agents. The response to immunotherapy varies depending on identified autoantibodies. We report a dramatic response to dexmedetomidine in a patient with glycine receptor (GlyR) antibody-positive PERM who developed intractable clusters of myoclonic jerks and paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) that was highly refractory to conventional symptomatic treatment with GABAergic drugs and immunotherapy.Case Presentation: A 62-year-old Japanese man was transferred to our center for intermittent painful spasms that progressed in severity over the preceding 7 weeks. On admission, he had gaze-evoked nystagmus, and paroxysmal painful spasms/myoclonic jerks triggered by sound or touch. The myoclonic jerks rapidly worsened, along with the development of hyperekplexia, opisthotonus, and PSH, leading to prolonged apnea requiring mechanical ventilation. Brain and spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging was unremarkable. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed mild pleocytosis and oligoclonal bands. Surface electromyography confirmed simultaneous agonist-antagonist continuous motor unit activity. Based on the clinico-electrophysiological features, PERM was suspected. He was initially treated with intravenous steroids, immunoglobulin, benzodiazepines, and propofol, but the symptoms persisted. On day 9, he received a continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine, which resulted in dramatic reduction in the frequency of clusters of myoclonic jerks and PSH. The effect of dexmedetomidine was confirmed by surface electromyography. The addition of plasma exchange resulted in further clinical improvement. GlyR antibodies were identified in the CSF but not the serum, leading to the diagnosis of GlyR antibody-positive PERM.Conclusions: PERM is an immune-mediated disorder, but dexmedetomidine, a highly selective alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, may alleviate paroxysmal symptoms by decreasing noradrenergic neuronal activity, resulting in attenuation of antibody-mediated disinhibited increased motor and sympathetic activity. Dexmedetomidine may be useful as an adjunctive symptomatic therapy in PERM and related disorders.

TI  - A Case of Stiff Person Syndrome: Immunomodulatory Effect of Benzodiazepines <i>Successful Rituximab and Tizanidine Therapy</i>
AU  - Zdziarski, P
PY  - 2015
PD  - 
AB  - Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune disease. Most patients have high-titer antibodies against glutamate decarboxylase (GADAb), which is without practical value in disease monitoring. Benzodiazepines are the first line drugs, but long-term use is not well characterized.This report demonstrates ineffective benzodiazepine therapy of SPS that prompts tachyphylaxis, loss of responsiveness, and finally benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Convulsion and anxiety correlate with high level of creatine phosphokinase (CK). Although tonus and spasm attacks were successfully controlled by tizanidine, glutamate release inhibitor, the immune response, and autoimmune diabetes development require the plasmapheresis, mycophenolat mofetil, and rituximab therapy that results in a significant decrease of GADAb, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and CK normalization. Unfortunately, reintroduction of benzodiazepine was a source of rapid and high increase of CK, LDH, GADAb titer (up to 1:15,000), IGT, and SPS relapse. Contrary to previous publications, we observed IGT that correlated with high anti-GAD level, but without high immunogenetic susceptibility to haplotype human leukocyte antigens-DR3, DQw2.This preliminary observation and the last finding of immunomodulatory properties of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor suggest that increased antigenic stimulation during benzodiazepine therapy and glutamatergic hyperactivity could account for convulsions observed in SPS. Benzodiazepine withdrawal prompted alternative muscle relaxant therapy (tizanidine). Muscular and brain abnormalities observed in SPS indicate that noncardiac CK level may be a useful tool in SPS therapy monitoring.

AB  - A healthy 74-year-old woman was diagnosed with Stiff-Person (SP) syndrome (encephalopathy and stiff leg) with amphiphysin autoantibodies and T1N1M0 breast cancer (HER2+, PR-, ER-). She received immunotherapy (2 high-dose steroid cycles and 7 plasmapheresis sessions), followed by right mastectomy, axillary chain lymphadenectomy, and adjuvant chemotherapy (letrozole, trastuzumab, and cyclophosphamide), with poor clinical response (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 4). After discharge, she presented to the emergency department with seizures induced by knee flexion of the stiff leg (Video 1). EEG showed epileptic seizures initiating in the left temporal lobe (Figure). Reduced presynaptic GABAergic inhibition could be the underlying mechanism of the core signs of amphiphysin-SP, which might explain the presence of epilepsy in these patients.(1) However, no reflex proprioceptive seizures had been previously reported in SP.

AB  - Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) is a rare and disabling syndrome characterized by painful spasms, myoclonic jerks, hyperekplexia, brainstem signs, and dysautonomia, which is considered to be a severe form of stiff person spectrum disorder (SPSD) and is mostly associated with glycine receptor antibodies. The PERM has an acute or subacute course, with complex and varied initial symptoms mainly manifest as stiffness and pain. The authors present the case of a male patient admitted for intractable stiffness and paroxysmal myoclonus of the lower extremities preceded by a 5-day history of facial weakness. After admission, his symptoms deteriorated rapidly. He developed progressive generalized hypertonia and painful spasms, which quickly spread to the upper extremities, and he suffered frequent paroxysmal myoclonus. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were tested by a cell-based assay, and both were positive for glycine receptor antibodies (GlyR-Abs). The patient developed complications, such as crushed teeth, lumbar vertebral compression fractures, and psoas major muscle abscess, during rapid disease progression, although he responded well after being treated with intravenous methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin. This report of PERM, initiated as facial palsy followed by acute progression, helps to expand the clinical spectrum of this rare autoimmune disorder and raise awareness of the prevention of complications.

AB  - Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) is a major islet cell autoantigen in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and autoantibodies are found in high frequencies in patients with recent-onset IDDM, stiff-man syndrome (SMS), and autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type I (APS I). Antigens in autoimmune disorders are often enzymes, and autoantibody binding frequently inhibit their activity. In this study, we examined the reactivity of anti-GAD-containing sera from 7 patients with IDDM, 4 patients with SMS, and 5 patients with APS I. All sera immunoprecipitated GAD from [S-35]methionine-labeled rat islet lysates and the sera from patients with SMS and APS I, but none of the IDDM patients' sera, identified the GAD protein in Western blots. Two of four SMS patients' sera and 5 of 5 APS I patients' sera, in contrast to 0 of 7 IDDM patients' sera, inhibited the enzymatic activity of GAD. When the various sera were tested with the GAD(65) and GAD(67) isoforms, produced separately by transient expression in COS cells, the enzymatic activity of GAD(65) was inhibited by sera from patients with SMS and APS I, whereas no effect on the GAD(67) activity was observed. Taken together, the results demonstrate that the GAD autoantibodies in these three disorders display marked differences in epitope recognition and indicate that, during the development of the diseases, the autoantigen is being presented to the immune system through separate pathogenetic mechanisms.

AB  - Background: Patients with stiff-person syndrome (SPS) have circulating antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for the synthesis of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Although the patients' symptoms of stiffness and unexpected spasms can be explained on the basis of reduced or impaired inhibitory neuro transmitters, such as GABA, it is unclear whether the level of GABA in the brains of these patients is reduced and, if so, whether the reduction is due to anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies.Objective: To measure GABA levels in the brains of patients with SPS.Design: Prospective case-control study.Setting: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.Patients: Eight patients with SPS with high titers of circulating anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies and typical clinical symptoms of SPS and 16 control subjects.Main Outcome Measures: Results of brain magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which measures GABA levels in specific brain regions.Results: No abnormalities were noted on brain magnetic resonance images. A prominent and significant decrease in GABA level was, however, observed in the sensorimotor cortex and a smaller decrease in the posterior occipital cortex but not in the cingulate cortex or pons.Conclusions: The reduction of brain GABA in patients with SPS supports the clinical symptoms and indicates that the inhibitory GABAergic pathways are involved in the disease. Regardless of the responsible autoantigens, in SPS autoantibodies block the function of GABAergic neurons and interfere with the synthesis of GABA but do not cause structural changes in the brain.

AB  - Background: gamma-Aminobutyric acid-B receptor antibodies (GABA(B)R-ab) were recently described in 15 patients with limbic encephalitis (LE), associated with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) or with concurrent glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies. We analyzed the frequency of GABA(B)R-ab in 147 patients with LE or neurologic syndromes associated with GAD-ab.Methods: We examined the presence of GABA(B)R-ab in 70 patients with LE (33 paraneoplastic with onconeural antibodies, 18 paraneoplastic without onconeural antibodies [5 with Gad-ab], and 19 idiopathic with either GAD-ab [5 patients] or seronegative) and 77 patients with GAD-ab-associated neurologic syndromes other than LE (29 stiff-person syndrome, 28 cerebellar ataxia, 14 epilepsy, and 6 with diverse paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes). GABA(B)R-ab were analyzed in serum or CSF by indirect immunofluorescence on HEK293 cells transfected with GABA(B1) and GABA(B2) receptor subunits.Results: GABA(B)R-ab were detected in 10 of the 70 patients with LE (14%). Eight had SCLC and 2 were idiopathic. One of the 8 patients with LE with SCLC had an additional onconeural antibody (Hu) and 2 GAD-ab. GABA(B)R-ab were identified in 7 (70%) of the 10 patients with LE and SCLC without onconeural antibodies. GABA(B)R-ab antibodies were not found in patients with GAD-ab and stiff-person syndrome, idiopathic cerebellar ataxia, or epilepsy. However, one patient with GAD-ab, paraneoplastic cerebellar ataxia, and anaplastic carcinoid of the thymus also presented GABA(B)R-ab.Conclusions: GABA(B)R-ab are the most common antibodies found in LE associated with SCLC previously considered "seronegative." In patients with GAD-ab, the frequency of GABA(B)R-ab is low and only observed in the context of cancer. Neurology (R) 2011;76:795-800

AB  - Objective: To characterize the specificity of anti-GAD(65) antibodies in patients with stiff person syndrome (SPS), quantify antibody titers, and examine antibody production within the CNS. Methods: The authors studied 18 patients with SPS and positive serum immunoreactivity to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic neurons. The reactivity of serum and CSF to purified GAD antigen was examined by Western blots, and the anti-GAD(65) antibody titers in serum and CSF were quantified by ELISA and compared with 70 disease controls (49 with other autoimmune disorders and 11 with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus). The intrathecal synthesis of anti-GAD(65) IgG was calculated, and the functional significance of the antibodies was examined by measuring the GABA levels in the CSF. Results: The serum and CSF of all selected patients with SPS had high anti-GAD(65) titers (from 7.0 to 215 mug/mL in serum and from 92 to 2500 ng/mL in CSF) and immunoreacted strongly with recombinant GAD(65) on Western blots and with GABA-ergic neurons on rat cerebellum. Among controls, only the serum of eight patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus had low anti-GAD(65) antibody titers (from 200 to 1760 ng/mL) but no reactivity to recombinant GAD(65). The CSF showed oligoclonal IgG bands in 10 (67%) of 15 patients and an increased anti-GAD(65)-specific IgG index in 11 (85%) of 13. The mean level of GABA in the CSF was lower in patients with SPS than in controls. Conclusions: In patients with SPS, there is marked intrathecal antibody response against neuronal GAD(65) epitopes, indicating a clonal B cell activation in the CNS. Anti-GAD(65) antibodies at high titers, when confirmed with immunoblots, are highly specific for SPS and appear to impair GABA synthesis.

AB  - Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) is a rare neurological disease of unknown etiology, and most patients with PERM are positive for anti-glycine receptor (GlyR) antibody. In this case study, we report a clinical case of a varicella-zoster virus-infected patient who developed anti-GlyR antibody-positive PERM. He initially suffered from herpes zoster and gradually developed symptoms of impaired brainstem functions including hoarse voice and dysphagia, accompanied by paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity. The patient also suffered from severe spasms, which were easily triggered by external stimuli. Glycine receptor antibodies were then found to be positive in serum and cerebrospinal fluid, and the diagnosis of PERM was confirmed. Methylprednisolone and gamma globulin treatments were given, and spasms were improved after treatment. Unfortunately, the patient's family insisted on automatic discharge and the patient passed away several days later.

AB  - The MDS Video Challenge continues to be the one of most widely attended sessions at the International Congress. Although the primary focus of this event is the presentation of complex and challenging cases through videos, a number of cases over the years have also presented an unusual or important neuroimaging finding related to the case. We reviewed the previous Video Challenge cases and present here a selection of those cases which incorporated such imaging findings. We have compiled these "imaging pearls" into two anthologies. The first focuses on pearls where the underlying diagnosis was a genetic condition. This second anthology focuses on imaging pearls in cases where the underlying condition was acquired. For each case we present brief clinical details along with neuroimaging findings, the characteristic imaging findings of that disorder and, finally, the differential diagnosis for the imaging findings seen.

AB  - Background and purpose: Despite their detrimental impact on the quality of life in autoimmune encephalitis, sleep disorders have not been investigated in anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) associated neurological syndromes.Methods: Six consecutive adult patients diagnosed with anti-GAD65-associated neurological syndromes (four with limbic encephalitis and two with stiff-person syndrome) and 12 healthy controls were enrolled. Participants underwent sleep interviews and sleep studies including night-time video-polysomnography, followed by five daytime multiple sleep latency tests (MSLTs, to assess propensity to fall asleep) and an 18 h bed rest polysomnography (to assess excessive sleep need).Results: Patients reported the need for daily naps and that their cognition and quality of life were altered by sleepiness, but they had normal scores on the Epworth sleepiness scale. Compared with controls, sleep latencies during the MSLT were shorter in the patient group (median 5.8 min, interquartile range [IQR] 4.5, 6.0 vs. 17.7 min, IQR 16.3, 19.7, p = 0.001), and the arousal index was reduced (2.5/h, IQR 2.3, 3.0 vs. 22.3/h, IQR 13.8, 30.0, p = 0.002), although total sleep time was similar between groups (621 min, IQR 464, 651 vs. 542.5 min, IQR 499, 582, p = 0.51). Remarkably, all six patients had MSLT latencies <= 8 min, indicating severe sleepiness. No parasomnia or sleep-disordered breathing was detected.Conclusion: Central hypersomnia is a relevant characteristic of anti-GAD65-associated neurological syndromes.

AB  - Autoimmune neurological syndromes (AINS) with autoantibodies against the 65kDa isoform of the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) present with limbic encephalitis, including temporal lobe seizures or epilepsy, cerebellitis with ataxia, and stiff-person-syndrome or overlap forms. Anti-GAD65 autoantibodies are also detected in autoimmune diabetes mellitus, which has a strong genetic susceptibility conferred by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and non-HLA genomic regions. We investigated the genetic predisposition in patients with anti-GAD65 AINS.We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and an association analysis of the HLA region in a large German cohort of 1214 individuals. These included 167 patients with anti-GAD65 AINS, recruited by the German Network for Research on Autoimmune Encephalitis (GENERATE), and 1047 individuals without neurological or endocrine disease as population-based controls. Predictions of protein expression changes based on GWAS findings were further explored and validated in the CSF proteome of a virtually independent cohort of 10 patients with GAD65-AINS and 10 controls. Our GWAS identified 16 genome-wide significant (P < 5 x 10(-8)) loci for the susceptibility to anti-GAD65 AINS. The top variant, rs2535288 [P = 4.42 x 10(-16), odds ratio (OR) = 0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.187-0.358], localized to an intergenic segment in the middle of the HLA class I region. The great majority of variants in these loci (>90%) mapped to non-coding regions of the genome. Over 40% of the variants have known regulatory functions on the expression of 48 genes in disease relevant cells and tissues, mainly CD4(+) T cells and the cerebral cortex. The annotation of epigenomic marks suggested specificity for neural and immune cells. A network analysis of the implicated protein-coding genes highlighted the role of protein kinase C beta (PRKCB) and identified an enrichment of numerous biological pathways participating in immunity and neural function. Analysis of the classical HLA alleles and haplotypes showed no genome-wide significant associations. The strongest associations were found for the DQA1*03:01-DQB1*03:02-DRB1*04:01HLA haplotype (P = 4.39 x 10(-4), OR = 2.5, 95%CI = 1.499-4.157) and DRB1*04:01 allele (P = 8.3 x 10(-5), OR = 2.4, 95%CI = 1.548-3.682) identified in our cohort. As predicted, the CSF proteome showed differential levels of five proteins (HLA-A/B, C4A, ATG4D and NEO1) of expression quantitative trait loci genes from our GWAS in the CSF proteome of anti-GAD65 AINS.These findings suggest a strong genetic predisposition with direct functional implications for immunity and neural function in anti-GAD65 AINS, mainly conferred by genomic regions outside the classical HLA alleles.

AB  - Objectives:Anti-dipeptidyl-peptidase-like protein 6 (anti-DPPX) encephalitis an extremely rare type of immune-mediated encephalitis. This study aimed to analyze the electroclinical characteristics and prognosis of anti-DPPX encephalitis. Methods:Five patients (all male) with anti-DPPX encephalitis in East China from January 2016 to October 2021 was retrospective analyzed. Electroclinical features and outcomes were reviewed. Results:All five patients were male. The media age at disease onset was 32 years old with a range of 14-56 years. The main symptoms included psychiatric disturbances (2/5), amnesia (4/5), confusion (3/5), and seizures (3/5). Migrating myoclonus were identified in patient 4 with positive DPPX and contactin-associated protein-like 2 antibodies in blood. All of the patients had positive DPPX antibodies in serum. Only one of them had positive antibody in the cerebrospinal fluid. EEG showed diffuse slowing in two patients, but no epileptiform discharges were observed. Eighty percent (4/5) of the patients showed normal brain magnetic resonance imaging. After immunotherapy, improvement of neuropsychiatric symptoms from all of the patients was observed. Over a mean follow-up of 30.8 weeks, all of the patients had marked improvement in the modified Rankin Scale. To date, no tumors were not observed in any patients. Conclusions:Anti-DPPX encephalitis mainly presents as neuropsychiatric symptoms. Cooperation of DPPX antibodies and CASPR2 antibodies might have contributed to the migration of myoclonus in the patient 4. Prompt immunotherapy often results in improvement.

AB  - ObjectiveTo describe clinical phenotypes and prognosis of neurological autoimmunity related to glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) antibodies in China. MethodIn this retrospective observational study from Peking Union Medical College Hospital, we identified patients with neurological disorders related to GAD65 antibodies (cell-based assay) from May 2015 to September 2021. Clinical manifestations, immunotherapy responsiveness, and outcomes were collected after obtaining informed consent from all patients. ResultsFifty-five patients were included: 40 (72.73%) were women and initial neurological symptoms developed at 42(34-55) years of age. The median time to the nadir of the disease was 5 months (range from 1 day to 48 months). The clinical syndromes included limbic encephalitis (LE) or epilepsy (Ep) (n = 34, 61.82%), stiff-person syndromes (SPS) (n = 18, 32.73%), autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (ACA) (n = 11, 20%), and overlap syndrome in eight (14.55%) patients. Thirty-two (58.2%) patients had comorbidities of other autoimmune diseases, including Hashimoto thyroiditis (n = 17, 53.13%), T1DM (n = 11, 34.78%), vitiligo (n = 6, 18.75%), and others (n=5, 15.63%). Two (3.64%) patients had tumors, including thymoma and small cell lung cancer. Fifty-one (92.7%) patients received first-line immunotherapy (glucocorticoids and/or IV immunoglobulin), and 4 (7.3%) received second-line immunotherapy (rituximab). Long-term immunotherapy (mycophenolate mofetil) was administered to 23 (41.8%) patients. At the median time of 15 months (IQR 6-33.75 month, range 3-96 month) of follow-up, the patients' median modified Rankin Score (mRS) had declined from 2 to 1. Thirty-eight (70.4%) patients experienced clinical improvement (mRS declined >= 1), 47 (87%) had favorable clinical outcomes (mRS <= 2), and nine were symptom-free (16.7%). The sustained response to immunotherapy ranged from 7/15 (63.63%) in ACA patients and 22/34 (64.7%) in LE/Ep patients to 14/17 (82.35%) in SPS patients. ConclusionsLE/Ep was the most common neurological phenotype of GAD65 antibody neurological autoimmunity in our cohort. Most patients had comorbidities of other autoimmune diseases, but underlying tumors were rare. Most patients responded to immunotherapy. However, the long-term prognosis varied among different clinical phenotypes.

AB  - Background and Objectives To determine the real-world use of rituximab in autoimmune encephalitis (AE) and to correlate rituximab treatment with the long-term outcome. Methods Patients with NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-AE, leucine-rich glioma-inactivated-1 (LGI1)- AE, contactin-associated protein-like-2 (CASPR2)-AE, or glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) disease from the GErman Network for Research on AuToimmune Encephalitis who had received at least 1 rituximab dose and a control cohort of non-rituximab-treated patients were analyzed retrospectively. Results Of the 358 patients, 163 (46%) received rituximab (NMDAR-AE: 57%, CASPR2-AE: 44%, LGI1-AE: 43%, and GAD65 disease: 37%). Rituximab treatment was initiated significantly earlier in NMDAR- and LGI1-AE (median: 54 and 155 days from disease onset) compared with CASPR2-AE or GAD65 disease (median: 632 and 1,209 days). Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores improved significantly in patients with NMDAR-AE, both with and without rituximab treatment. Although being more severely affected at baseline, rituximab-treated patients with NMDAR-AE more frequently reached independent living (mRS score <= 2) (94% vs 88%). In LGI1-AE, rituximab-treated and nontreated patients improved, whereas in CASPR2-AE, only rituximab-treated patients improved significantly. No improvement was observed in patients with GAD65 disease. A significant reduction of the relapse rate was observed in rituximab-treated patients (5% vs 13%). Detection of NMDAR antibodies was significantly associated with mRS score improvement. A favorable outcome was also observed with early treatment initiation. Discussion We provide real-world data on immunosuppressive treatments with a focus on rituximab treatment for patients with AE in Germany. We suggest that early and short-term rituximab therapy might be an effective and safe treatment option in most patients with NMDAR-, LGI1-, and CASPR2-AE. Class of Evidence This study provides Class IV evidence that rituximab is an effective treatment for some types of AE.

AB  - AimThis study aimed to examine the imaging characteristics and clinical and MRI correlates of brain F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG)-PET imaging in patients with paraneoplatic neurological syndrome.Materials and methodsData of patients diagnosed with paraneoplastic neurological syndrome were retrospectively reviewed using the electronic medical records of the patients, looking specifically at records of hospital stays, laboratory findings and imaging reports. Both brain MRI and F-18-FDG-PET imaging characteristics were analyzed and compared.ResultsA total of 19 patients (ages 26-78; 13 female and six male patients) with clinical diagnoses of PNS were analyzed in this study. Limbic encephalitis (paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis) was found in 10 patients, seven of whom had a diagnosis of cancer. Brain F-18-FDG-PET showed bilaterally increased mesial temporal F-18-FDG uptake in eight of 10 patients with limbic encephalitis; seven of these eight patients exhibited memory loss. There was also a notable reduction in general cortical F-18-FDG uptake (including in the primary visual cortex) in six of the 10 patients with limbic encephalitis; three of the six patients had their primary motor cortices spared, two of them being spared bilaterally. Five of the seven limbic encephalitis patients with diagnosed cancer and two of the three without it had the aforementioned cortical and temporal lobe findings. Of the eight patients with onconeuronal antibodies, seven had temporal lobe enhancement and a total of six had diffuse cortical dysfunction. One patient with paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis without antibodies had demonstrated severely increased F-18-FDG uptake in both occipital lobes extending to the temporal lobes. The other patient without antibodies had a normal PET scan. Only one patient among four with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration had demonstrated decreased cerebellar uptake on F-18-FDG-PET that correlated with atrophy of the cerebellar vermis on MRI. Three patients had a clinical diagnosis of sensory neuropathy, of whom one demonstrated mild bilateral decrease in F-18-FDG uptake in the mesial temporal lobes, one showed notable increase in F-18-FDG uptake in the right mesial temporal lobe (with normal MRI) and the other had a normal brain F-18-FDG-PET. One patient was found to have cerebellar findings paired with oculomotor findings and showed increased F-18-FDG uptake in the cerebellum. One patient with stiff-person syndrome had normal brain F-18-FDG-PET.ConclusionThe pattern of abnormalities in the brain F-18-FDG-PET images usually correlates well with the corresponding clinical settings and presentations. Although quite frequently findings correlate with those of MRI, at times F-18-FDG-PET can demonstrate functional abnormality in the absence of any MRI finding, which could give a therapeutic window before anatomical changes set in.
