Initialized the reproducible SPS-review repository structure and added source reference exports for downstream extraction and verification.
Then implemented and iteratively improved the PDF-to-JSON text extraction pipeline in `src/pipelines/01_extract_text.py`.

Key progress on this date (from commit history):
- Repository bootstrap and folder structure (`ab90651`).
- Reference files added (`417f639`).
- First extraction implementation and JSON output draft (`3acec10`).
- Refactor for clearer function structure and maintainability (`85064fc`).
- OCR support integrated into extraction flow and README updates (`f597040`).
- Initial LangExtract pipeline script scaffold and top-level README update (`1d942d1`).
- Column/quality dictionaries added and aligned with JSON configs (`0ce5d7c`, `14cb64e`).

Session progress completed today:
- Validated extraction end-to-end on current PDF set.
- Confirmed OCR auto-detection and fallback using a non-OCR test PDF (`118492_...`), with post-OCR extraction marked successful in output JSON.
- Installed and configured OCR dependencies (Python + system tools):
  - `pypdf`, `tqdm`, `ocrmypdf`
  - Tesseract OCR
  - Ghostscript
- Configured both Git Bash and PowerShell environments so OCR tooling resolves by command.
- Added `src/pipelines/README.md` documenting the extraction script behavior and outputs.
- Installed OpenAI-ready LangExtract stack in `.venv`:
  - `langextract[openai]`
  - verified imports for `langextract` and `openai`.
